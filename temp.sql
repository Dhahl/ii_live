After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London\'s most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. Today he is remembered for his epigrams, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death.\r\n\r\nWilde\'s parents were successful Anglo-Irish Dublin intellectuals. Their son became fluent in French and German early in life. At university, Wilde read Greats; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at Dublin, then at Oxford. He became known for his involvement in the rising philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new \"English Renaissance in Art\", and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversation, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote Salome (1891) in French in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to the absolute prohibition of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London.\r\n\r\nAt the height of his fame and success, while his masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), was still on stage in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde\'s lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The charge carried a penalty of up to two years in prison. The trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with other men. After two more trials he was convicted and imprisoned for two years\' hard labour. In 1897, in prison, he wrote De Profundis, which was published in 1905, a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.

During the 1930s and 1940s he wrote his first novels and short stories. He wrote a trilogy of novels in the 1950s as well as famous plays like Waiting for Godot. In 1969 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His later works included poetry and short story collections and novellas. He died on December 22, 1989 in Paris, France.\r\nSamuel Barclay Beckett was born on Good Friday, April 13, 1906, in Dublin, Ireland. His father, William Frank Beckett, worked in the construction business and his mother, Maria Jones Roe, was a nurse. Young Samuel attended Earlsfort House School in Dublin, then at 14, he went to Portora Royal School, the same school attended by Oscar Wilde. He received his Bachelor’s degree from Trinity College in 1927. Referring to his childhood, Samuel Beckett, once remaking, “I had little talent for happiness.” In his youth he would periodically experience severe depression keeping him in bed until mid-day. This experience would later influence his writing.\r\nIn 1928, Samuel Beckett found a welcome home in Paris where he met and became a devoted student of James Joyce. In 1931, he embarked on a restless sojourn through Britain, France and Germany. He wrote poems and stories and did odd jobs to support himself. On his journey, he came across many individuals who would inspire some of his most interesting characters.\r\nIn 1937, Samuel Beckett settled in Paris. Shortly thereafter, he was stabbed by a pimp after refusing his solicitations. While recovering in the hospital, he met Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnuil, a piano student in Paris. The two would become life-long companions and eventually marry. After meeting with his attacker, Beckett dropped the charges, partly to avoid the publicity.\r\nDuring World War II, Samuel Beckett’s Irish citizenship allowed him to remain in Paris as a citizen of a neutral country. He fought in the resistance movement until 1942 when members of his group were arrested by the Gestapo. He and Suzanne fled to the unoccupied zone until the end of the war.\r\nAfter the war, Samuel Beckett was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery during his time in the French resistance. He settled in Paris and began his most prolific period as a writer. In five years, he wrote Eleutheria, Waiting for Godot, Endgame, the novels Malloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable, andMercier et Camier, two books of short stories, and a book of criticism.\r\nSamuel Beckett’s first publication, Molloy, enjoyed modest sales, but more importantly praise from French critics. Soon, Waiting for Godot, achieved quick success at the small Theatre de Babylone putting Beckett in the international spotlight. The play ran for 400 performances and enjoyed critical praise.\r\nSamuel Beckett wrote in both French and English, but his most well-known works, written between WWII and the 1960s, were written in French. Early on he realized his writing had to be subjective and come from his own thoughts and experiences. His works are filled with allusions to other writers such asDante, Rene Descartes, and James Joyce. Beckett’s plays are not written along traditional lines with conventional plot and time and place references. Instead, he focuses on essential elements of the human condition in dark humorous ways. This style of writing has been called “Theater of the Absurd” by Martin Esslin, referring to poet Albert Camus’ concept of “the absurd.” The plays focus on human despair and the will to survive in a hopeless world that offers no help in understanding.\r\nThe 1960s were a period of change for Samuel Beckett. He found great success with this plays across the world. Invitations came to attend rehearsals and performances which led to a career as a theater director. In 1961, he secretly married Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnuil who took care of his business affairs. A commission from the BBC in 1956 led to offers to write for radio and cinema through the 1960s.\r\nSamuel Beckett continued to write throughout the 1970s and 80s mostly in a small house outside Paris.

He was also an Irish republican and a volunteer in the Irish Republican Army. Born in Dublin into a republican family, he became a member of the IRA\'s youth organisation Fianna Éireann at the age of fourteen. However, there was also a strong emphasis on Irish history and culture in the home, which meant he was steeped in literature and patriotic ballads from an early age. Behan eventually joined the IRA at sixteen, which led to his serving time in a borstal youth prison in the United Kingdom and he was also imprisoned in Republic of Ireland. During this time, he took it upon himself to study and he became a fluent speaker of the Irish language. Subsequently released from prison as part of a general amnesty given by the Fianna Fáil government in 1946, Behan moved between homes in Dublin, Kerry and Connemara, and also resided in Paris for a time. In 1954, Behan\'s first play The Quare Fellow, was produced in Dublin. It was well received; however, it was the 1956 production at Joan Littlewood\'s Theatre Workshop in Stratford, London, that gained Behan a wider reputation. This was helped by a famous drunken interview on BBC television. In 1958, Behan\'s play in the Irish language An Giall had its debut at Dublin\'s Damer Theatre. Later, The Hostage, Behan\'s English-language adaptation of An Giall, met with great success internationally. Behan\'s autobiographical novel, Borstal Boy, was published the same year and became a worldwide best-seller. He married Beatrice Ffrench-Salkeld in 1955. Behan was known for his drinking problem, which resulted in his suffering from diabetes, which ultimately resulted in his death on 20 March 1964. He was given an IRA guard of honour, which escorted his coffin. It was described by several newspapers as the biggest funeral since those of Michael Collins and Charles Stewart Parnell.

It was subsequently doused by another English teacher in St Paul’s College in Dublin.\r\n\r\nAt college in University College, Dublin I studied History and Politics with the intention of becoming a journalist. I worked for several national newspapers as a financial and news reporter, feature writer, sub-editor, music columnist and gossip columnist. I also worked as a freelance feature writer and sold my work to newspapers and magazines throughout the world including Mojo, Q, Select, New Musical Express, Rolling Stone, Washington Post, Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Telegraph.\r\n\r\nI published one book.

An interview with the two authors formed a major feature in The Irish Times Magazine in November 2009.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s, Turtle studied history at Trinity College Dublin. After three years living in Hong Kong, he enjoyed a career as a roving historian in Ireland for a travel website. In 2004, he published his first book on Ireland’s ‘Big House’ families. His travel-writing career also flourished when he won Ireland’s Longhaul Journalist of the Year Award in 2006.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, James Fennell completed his visual media studies in Dublin and began working as an apprentice for various photographers, primarily the successful fashion photographer Perry Ogden.

His home language of childhood was Ulster Scots. Educated at Stranmillis College in Belfast, and later Queen\'s University, he became a teacher at schools in Belfast.\r\n\r\nHis poetry in Ulster Scots, at times lively, contented, wistful, is written in contemporary Ulster Scots, and particularly the dialect of Ballinaloob (\"Belnaloob\" in his poem Thonner an Thon).','','','','placeholder.jpg',0,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fenton'),(450,' James','Joyce','1882-02-02','James Joyce (1882 – 1941) is one of Ireland’s most influential and celebrated writers. His most famous work is Ulysses (1922) which follows the movements of Leopold Bloom through a single day on June 16th, 1904. Ulysses is based on Homer’s The Odyssey.\r\n\r\nSome of Joyce’s other major works include the short story collection Dubliners (1914), and novels A Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). Joyce was born in Dublin on 2nd February 1882 and attended school in Clongowes Wood College and Belvedere College (just up the road from the Centre) before going on to University College, then located on St Stephen’s Green, where he studied modern languages.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from university, Joyce went to Paris, ostensibly to study medicine, and was recalled to Dublin in April 1903 because of the illness and subsequent death of his mother. He stayed in Ireland until 1904, and in June that year he met Nora Barnacle, the Galway woman who was to become his partner and later his wife.\r\n\r\nIn August 1904 the first of Joyce’s short stories was published in the Irish Homestead magazine, followed by two others, but in October Joyce and Nora left Ireland going first to Pola (now Pula, Croatia) where Joyce got a job teaching English at a Berlitz school. After he left Ireland in 1904, Joyce only made four return visits, the last of those in 1912, after which he never returned to Ireland.\r\n\r\n1914 proved a crucial year for Joyce. With Ezra Pound’s assistance, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce’s first novel, began to appear in serial form in Harriet Weaver’s Egoist magazine in London. His collection of short stories, Dubliners, on which he had been working since 1904, was finally published, and he also wrote his only play, Exiles. It was after these successes that Joyce began to think seriously about writing the novel he had been formulating since 1907: Ulysses.\r\n\r\nWith the start of World War One, Joyce and Nora, along with their two children, Giorgio and Lucia, were forced to leave Trieste and arrived in Zurich where they lived for the duration of the war. It was during this time that Joyce worked on Ulysses and included many characteristics of those around him in the characters of the book. Though Joyce wanted to settle in Trieste again after the War, the poet Ezra Pound persuaded him to come to Paris for a while, and Joyce stayed there for the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nIt was in Paris that Joyce met Sylvia Beach, an American ex-pat who helped him to publish Ulysses for the first time in 1922. From 1930, after Beach had relinquished the rights to Ulysses, Joyce became very close with Paul Léon, another ex-pat living in Paris. Léon became Joyce’s business advisor and close friend and helped him to publish his final book Finnegans Wake in 1939.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, when Joyce fled to the south of France ahead of the Nazi invasion, Léon returned to the Joyces’ apartment in Paris to salvage their belongings and put them into safekeeping for the duration of the war. It’s thanks to Léon’s efforts that many of Joyce’s personal possessions and manuscripts still survive today. James Joyce died at the age of fifty-nine, on 13 January 1941 in Schwesterhaus vom Roten Kreuz in Zurich where he and his family had been given asylum. He is buried in Fluntern cemetery, Zurich.

He studied at the University College Galway, the University of Manchester and Indiana University.\r\n\r\nMichael D. Higgins is married to Sabina Higgins, and they have four children. Sabina Higgins attended the Stanislavsky Studio of acting in Dublin and was a founding member of the Focus Theatre.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer in political science and sociology in National University of Ireland, Galway, and in the United States, Michael D. Higgins was a passionate proponent for the extension of access to third level education beyond the walls of established Universities. He was centrally involved in the development of extra-mural studies at National University of Ireland, Galway, and he travelled extensively across the West of Ireland to provide accessible evening classes for interested citizens.\r\n\r\nA desire to work more directly for equality and justice led Michael D. Higgins to enter public life and he went on to serve as a public representative at many levels from Councillor and Mayor to 9 years in the Seanad and 25 in Dáil Éireann.\r\n\r\nAs Ireland’s first Minister for the Arts in 1993-97, Michael D. Higgins’ achievements included the reinvigoration of the Irish film industry, the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge, now TG4, and the repeal of censorship under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Acts. He also established a rich network of local arts and cultural venues which brought a crucial access to citizens across Ireland to these facilities. Moreover, he drove the revitalisation of Ireland’s canal network, resulting in over 1,000 kilometres of navigable waterways, supporting thousands of jobs, and creating wealth in many rural and economically-deprived areas of the State.\r\n\r\nMichael D. Higgins has, like many in Ireland, seen generations of his family emigrate. He has a strong interest and solidarity with the Irish abroad and has been a regular visitor to Irish Centres in Britain.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Michael D. Higgins has campaigned for human rights and for the promotion of peace and democracy in Ireland and in many other parts of the world, from Nicaragua and Chile to Cambodia, Iraq and Somalia. In 1992, Michael D. Higgins was the first recipient of the Seán MacBride Peace Prize from the International Peace Bureau in Helsinki, in recognition of his work for peace and justice in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nMichael D. Higgins is also a writer and poet, contributing to many books covering diverse aspects of Irish politics, sociology, history and and culture. He has published two collections of essays — ‘Causes for Concern — Irish Politics, Culture and Society’ and ‘Renewing the Republic’. He has also published four collections of poetry — ’The Betrayal; The Season of Fire; An Arid Season’ and ‘New and Selected Poems’.

He spent his childhood in County Sligo, where his parents were raised, and in London. He returned to Dublin at the age of fifteen to continue his education and study painting, but quickly discovered he preferred poetry. Born into the Anglo-Irish landowning class, Yeats became involved with the Celtic Revival, a movement against the cultural influences of English rule in Ireland during the Victorian period, which sought to promote the spirit of Ireland’s native heritage. Though Yeats never learned Gaelic himself, his writing at the turn of the century drew extensively from sources in Irish mythology and folklore. Also a potent influence on his poetry was the Irish revolutionary Maud Gonne, whom he met in 1889, a woman equally famous for her passionate nationalist politics and her beauty. Though she married another man in 1903 and grew apart from Yeats (and Yeats himself was eventually married to another woman, Georgie Hyde Lees), she remained a powerful figure in his poetry.','','','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats','author819.jpg',0,'http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-butler-yeats'),(821,' Walter','Macken','1915-05-03','Walter Macken (3 May 1915 - 22 April 1967) (Irish Uaitéar Ó Maicín), was born in Galway, Ireland.

His academic career was marked by productive sabbaticals in the USA (where he spent extended periods in the Woodrow Wilson Center, Washington DC; Colgate University; Mount Holyoke College; the University of Georgia; and, as Burns Professor, Boston College). His academic distinction was marked by his election as a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 2003.\r\n\r\nGarvin’s academic output includes 60 articles in journals, chapters in books, and publications of similar type; six books, with a further two forthcoming; two edited volumes; and a range of publications of other kinds. The best-known of his books form a sequence dealing with successive themes in the emergence of modern Ireland: \"The evolution of Irish nationalist politics\" (1981, 1983); \"Nationalist revolutionaries in Ireland 1858-1928\" (1987); \"1922: the birth of Irish democracy\" (1996); and \"Preventing the future: why was Ireland so poor for so long\" (2004).\r\n\r\nTom Garvin retired on 1 September 2008 after working for 41 years in what is now the UCD School of Politics and International Relations.

He was named National Newspapers of Ireland Columnist of the Year in 2013 for his weekly column in The Irish Times on Saturday written under the Ross O\'Carroll-Kelly pseudonym. The column began in the sports pages of The Sunday Tribune in January 1998. The inspiration for the columns first came from a nonfiction article Howard was researching on Leinster schools rugby. The information he had gathered on the social activities engaged in by the young rugby players was unprintable for legal reasons; instead, Howard decided to use the material to inspire a set of characters (including Ross) attending the fictional school of \"Castlerock\".','','','','author909.jpg',1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Howard_%28journalist%29'),(911,'Patrick','Kavanagh','1904-10-21','Patrick Kavanagh (1904-67) is one of Ireland\'s best-loved poets: when the Irish Times compiled a list of favourite Irish poems in 2000, ten of Kavanagh\'s were in the top fifty, with only Yeats\'s name appearing more frequently. Kavanagh rose to such literary pre-eminence from the humblest of backgrounds. Born in Inniskeen parish, Co. Monaghan, his father was a cobbler and a farmer of sixteen acres. Kavanagh left school at twelve to apprentice as a cobbler himself, but having no aptitude for shoe-making, he helped instead on the family farm. So for the first 27 years of his life, Kavanagh lived the life of rural Ireland, the life of \"fairs and football matches, of mass-going and dance-going.\" (Seamus Heaney, The Sense of Place, a lecture given in the Ulster Museum, 1977). At the same time, despite this entirely unbookish background, Kavanagh was drawn to writing poems, his first appearing in the local papers in 1928. As he said of his early poetic development, \"I dabbled in verse and it became my life.\" His poems began to appear further afield and this prompted Kavanagh to leave home in 1931 and walk to Dublin, where his brother was already a teacher, to try and further his literary aspirations. To an extent he was successful, his first collection, Ploughman and Other Poems, appearing in 1936. From the first his poetry was marked by a fidelity to local detail and the real experience of Irish rural life (as opposed to the sentimentalised version which he despised), coupled with a vigorous colloquial language. However, it was precisely these qualities that led the educated Anglo-Irish elite, who dominated Dublin literary life at the time, to patronise him, referring to him as \"that Monaghan boy\". Kavanagh eked out a living as a journalist but his tendency to tell the unvarnished truth, together with a self-belief in his poetic gifts, made him enemies. Recalling this period in the 1963 recording from which his Archive poems are taken, Kavanagh wryly says \"every potential employer said I was a genius and therefore unemployable.\" Nevertheless, he continue to publish including, in 1942, his long poem \'The Great Hunger\' which chronicles the privations - mental, spiritual and physical - of the rural life he knew so intimately. This was followed by a loosely autobiographical novel, Tarry Flynn (1948), which was briefly banned. The poems of this middle period are judged less successful, partly because the quarrel he had with the literary establishment gave them a polemical quality. This was essentially a quarrel with himself, divided as he was between love on the one hand and contempt on the other for his roots in the \"the little hills...and stony grey soil\" (Bertrand Russell – see above) of his home. However, in 1954 personal crisis was to set his poetry on a new course. Firstly, Kavanagh pursued and lost a notorious libel action against a Dublin newspaper and secondly he was diagnosed with cancer and had a lung removed. It was during his convalescence while sitting beside the Grand Canal in Dublin that he underwent what he described as a \"re-birth\". There followed his happiest years during which he produced some of his greatest poems, full of new found optimism and love of the world. He now, at long last, began to receive the acclaim he felt he deserved, giving lectures at University College Dublin and in the USA. In April 1967 he married Katharine Maloney. He died later the same year, a week after being taken ill at the opening performance of the adaptation of Tarry Flynn at the Abbey Theatre. - See more at: http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/patrick-kavanagh#sthash.RnkoUz62.dpuf','','Innishkeen, Co.

Seán Ó Súilleabháin, the former archivist for the Irish Folklore Commission, described her as \"one of the greatest woman storytellers of recent times\"\r\n\r\nShe was born Máiréad Sayers in the townland of Vicarstown, Dunquinn, County Kerry, the youngest child of the family.[2] She was called Peig after her mother, Margaret \"Peig\" Brosnan, from Castleisland. Her father Tomás Sayers was a renowned storyteller who passed on many of his tales to Peig. At age 12, she was taken out of school and went to work as a servant for the Curran family in the nearby town of Dingle, where she said she was well treated. She spent two years there before returning home due to illness.[3]\r\n\r\nShe spent the next few years as a domestic servant working for members of the growing middle class produced by the Land War. She had expected to join her best friend, Cáit Boland, in America, but Cáit wrote that she had had an accident and could not forward the cost of the fare. Peig moved to the Great Blasket Island after marrying Pádraig Ó Guithín,[2] a fisherman and native of the island. She and Pádraig had eleven children, of whom six survived.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian scholar Carl Marstrander, who visited the island in 1907, urged Robin Flower, of the British Museum, to visit the Blaskets. Flower was keenly appreciative of Peig Sayers\' stories and tales. He recorded them and brought them to the attention of the academic world.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s a Dublin teacher, Máire Ní Chinnéide, who was a regular visitor to the Blaskets, urged Peig to tell her life story to her son Micheál. Peig was illiterate in the Irish language, although she received her early schooling through the medium of English. She dictated her biography to Micheál. He then sent the manuscript pages to Máire Ní Chinnéide in Dublin, who edited them for publication. It was published in 1936.\r\n\r\nOver several years from 1938 she dictated 350 ancient legends, ghost stories, folk stories, and religious stories to Seosamh Ó Dálaigh of the Irish Folklore Commission.[1]\r\n\r\nShe continued to live on the island until 1942, when she left the Island and returned to her native place, Dunquin.[5] She was moved to a hospital in Dingle, County Kerry where she died in 1958. She is buried in the Dún Chaoin Burial Ground, Corca Dhuibhne, Ireland. Her surviving children, except for her son Micheál, emigrated to the USA and live with their descendants in Springfield, Massachusetts.[citation needed]\r\nBooks\r\n\r\nSayers is most famous for her autobiography, Peig, ISBN 0-8156-0258-8, but also recounted folklore and other stories which were recorded in Machnamh Seanmhná/An Old Woman\'s Reflections, ISBN 978-0-19-281239-1. The books were not written by Peig but were reminiscences which she dictated to others.\r\nPeig\r\n\r\nPeig is among the most famous expressions of a late Gaelic Revival genre of personal histories by and about inhabitants of the Blasket Islands and other remote Irish locations. Tomás Ó Criomhthain\'s memoir an tOileánach (\"the Islandman\", 1929) and Robert J. Flaherty\'s documentary Man of Aran address similar subjects. The movement swiftly found itself the object of some derision and mockery – especially among the more cosmopolitan city dwellers of Ireland - for its often relentless depictions of rural hardship. Parody of the type reached its zenith with Flann O\'Brien\'s satire of an tOileánach as an Béal Bocht (\"the Poor Mouth\").\r\n\r\nPeig depicts the declining years of a traditional, Irish-speaking way of life characterised by poverty, devout Catholicism, and folk memory of gang violence, the Great Famine, and the Penal Laws. The often bleak tone of the book is established from its opening words:\r\n“ 	I am an old woman now, with one foot in the grave and the other on its edge.

His early work focused on English society and institutions in Ireland. Since the mid-1980s a prominent aspect of his research has been the development of perspectives on Irish history in a British context and on Ireland as one of the Tudor borderlands. These perspectives were first explored in his Tudor Ireland, long the standard survey of the subject (extensively revised and extended for a new edition in 1998). More recently, he has also worked on his native north of England and on British state formation more generally. This work produced a pioneering analysis of marcher lordship and frontier society in the form of a monograph comparing Tudor Ireland and the English far north, and a comparative survey of early modern Britain and Ireland written from a ’New British’ perspective.

In 1962 his casual singing sessions with Barney McKenna, Luke Kelly and Ciarán Bourke evolved into something regular and the men started performing together as the group that became the Dubliners.\r\nIt was a seismic moment in Irish cultural history. The Dubliners combined brilliance, danger and a raucous earthiness, and they broke down the barriers between popular and traditional music. The group was, and remains, a source of inspiration to artists such as U2 and Shane MacGowan. And at its heart always - even after he had left it - was Ronnie Drew.\r\nIn the mid-1990s Ronnie developed a solo career that saw him combine his two passions, singing and story-telling, and explore his interests in a range of other artistic activities - everything from acting to jazz singing.

Passionate about sharing the beauty of the light from her near-death experience, in a way that people can connect with their own inner light, she was inspired to create a series of artworks – the Artist of the Light collection. Róisín’s primary intention through this art is to enhance well-being in both residential and corporate environments. She exhibits regularly on both sides of the Atlantic, with over ten exhibitions in the US over the past few years in Manhattan, Washington D.C. and the greater Boston area.','','','http://roisinfitzpatrick.com/index.php','author1991.jpg',1,'https://twitter.com/RoisinFitz'),(1992,'Rozanna','Purcell','0000-00-00','Model,Former miss universe Ireland (2010), GAA bainisteoir, cycling addict & a food lover!','','','http://www.naturalbornfeeder.com/','author1992.png',1,'https://twitter.com/rozannapurcell'),(1993,'Cory','Hanson','0000-00-00','Cory Hanson grew up in Iowa, where he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Secondary Instrumental Music Education at a small liberal arts college.

Frank McCourt’s critically-acclaimed, lyrical memoir of his Limerick childhood won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics’ Circle Award, the Royal Society of Literature Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Award amongst others, and rapidly became a word-of-mouth bestseller topping all charts worldwide for over two years. It left readers and critics alike eager to hear more about Frank McCourt’s incredible, poignant life.\r\n\r\n‘’Tis’ is the story of Frank’s American journey from impoverished immigrant with rotten teeth, infected eyes and no formal education to brilliant raconteur and schoolteacher. Saved first by a straying priest, then by the Democratic party, then by the United States Army, then by New York University – which admitted him on a trial basis though he had no high school diploma – Frank had the same vulnerable but invincible spirit at nineteen that he had at eight and still has today. And ‘‘Tis’ is a tale of survival as vivid, harrowing, and hilarious as Angela’s Ashes. Yet again, it is through the power of storytelling that Frank finds a life for himself. ‘It is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he’s done. McCourt proves himself one of the very best’ (Newsweek). ‘With ‘Tis’, McCourt blesses his readers with another chapter of his story, but as it closes, they will want still more.',14,'2014-05-31 08:57:06','1998-10-05','14.jpg','0007205244','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tis-Frank-McCourt/dp/0007205244/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1434614807&sr=1-1&keywords=tis',0,1,0,0,512,'978-0007205240','','English',0,0.0000,'0',''),('Kings of September: The Day Offaly Denied Kerry Five in a Row',' Michael Foley','','ABC','http://www.obrien.ie/','Sport',26,'Offaly','On the 19th September 1982 Kerry ran out in Croke Park chasing immortality.

A brilliantly witty reworking of the classical tale of the sculptor Pygmalion, who falls in love with his perfect female statue, it is also a barbed attack on the British class system and a statement of Shaw\'s feminist views. In Shaw\'s hands, the phoneticist Henry Higgins is the Pygmalion figure who believes he can transform Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, into a duchess at ease in polite society. The one thing he overlooks is that his \'creation\' has a mind of her own. Adapted into the Oscar-winning musical film My Fair Lady starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison in 1964, Pygmalion\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the definitive text produced under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence, with an illuminating introduction by Nicholas Grene, discussing the language and politics of the play. Also included in this volume is Shaw\'s preface, as well as his \'sequel\' written for the first publication in 1916, to rebut public demand for a more conventially romantic ending.\r\n\r\nAlthough essentially shy, Dublin-born George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) created the persona of GBS, the showman, satirist, conversationalist, critic, pundit, wit, intellectual buffoon and dramatist. Commentators brought a new adjective into English: \'Shavian\', a term used to embody all his brilliant qualities.

The naked body of a young man is washed up on a Donegal beach on Ireland\'s north-western coast. The local authorities in the form of the Royal Irish Constabulary show little interest in circumstances like this. The Catholic priest refuses to have anything to do with the burial of the stranger. A few locals take it upon themselves to lay him to rest in a shallow, unmarked grave on a local tidal island. He is in the company of countless infants who have been buried there over many generations, most of them victims of the horrendous Irish famine of the \'Hungry Forties\'. Their cemetery is Oileán na Márbh, \'the island of the dead\' where the nameless lie in limbo, between sea and sky, between earth and heaven. In a Scottish village a clergyman and his wife pore over the diary of their son, searching for clues about what has happened to him during a visit to Ireland. Andrew was a talented artist; he had been sent to Donegal to help his railway-planner uncle survey the route for a proposed line across the bogs of the county in an effort to bring some prosperity to the poverty-striken west. The diary seems to be all that remains of him and is a window to his innermost fears and joys. What his parents read shocks and saddens them, challenging their marriage, their life\'s work and their very faith. Meanwhile on Donegal’s western coast, Sean Ban Sweeney, who was the one to find the body on the shore, is struggling with his feelings for Annie O\'Donnell, his childhood sweetheart. Annie is different; beautiful, a uniquely talented musician but a lonely and damaged seventeen-year-old, cocooned in her silent world. Sean Ban tries to understand her as he leads his simple life on the land, oblivious to the circumstances and forces which are about to alter his life forever.

Depression in the industry followed by famine and its legacy spurred Doudney to initiate educational establishments to help the poor and deprived of the area, children particularly. These initiatives brought him into conflict with Catholic clergy who suspected him of engaging in proselytism. Doudney was more interested in encouraging a more vital Christianity in opposition to the nominalism he found around him whether among Catholics or Protestants, rather than in forced religious conversion. However, such a distinction was not clear at popular level. In the rising tensions that ensued and against the backdrop of a suspected suicide, Doudney was the object of bigoted opposition, a narrow xenophobia, and of threats to his life, that together forced his departure. Not without blemish himself for, characteristic of the Victorian age, he articulated a strong anti-Catholic rhetoric, which he directed against the doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church.',107,'2015-01-30 09:00:44','2014-05-06','107.jpg','1491726032','More Info...','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunmahon','AbeBooks.com','http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=1491726032&sts=t&x=42&y=1',0,1,0,0,338,'978-1491726037','0123456789','English',20,0.0000,'',''),('My Big Fake Irish Life','Caitlin McKenna','239','','','Fiction',11,'Ireland','Twenty-six-year-old Linda Symcox has been chasing her lifelong dream of becoming an actress for the last five years, so when she gets a chance to read for a popular television series, she takes an extended lunch in order to make the audition.

Though in a 1992 presidential pardon, Nicky Kelly was described as being as innocent as though never charged in relation to the 1978 Sallins mail train robbery, the Gardai\'s conduct of its investigation in the case has never been explained; nor has that of a judiciary which sentenced him to 12 years penal servitude and kept him in jail, despite appeal after appeal, until there was political intervention. Nicky Kelly was failed at every turn by the justice agencies of this State. In an age when the most powerful democracy in the world has shown scant regard for basic justice rights, it is timely to ask: where are the mechanisms in Ireland to prevent a possible repeat of the Nicky Kelly case? In \"Free Nicky Kelly\", \"Irish Times\" journalist Patsy McGarry talks to those who actually took part in the mail train robbery; gives an inside account by Nicky Kelly of what took place after his arrest, including his time on the run in Europe, Canada and the US; relates his return to Ireland and to jail, his prolonged hunger strike and the campaign which led to his release, his eventual pardon and compensation by the State; describes Nicky\'s own international campaign on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six; and raises the unanswered questions as to how it all could have happened. In \"Free Nicky Kelly\", 30 years later, the full story of this miscarriage of justice can finally be told. This is a fascinating look at what can happen when a democratic state and some of its most important institutions - its Government, its judiciary, its intelligence services and police - panic before a perceived threat and then fail in upholding the basic princip',115,'2015-02-13 19:06:00','2006-10-13','115.jpg','1905785046','One man\'s fight against the state for jusatice and fairplay.

Galloping Green','Between the years of the mid thirties through to 1960, independent Ireland suffered from economic stagnation, and also went through a period of intense cultural and psychological repression. While external circumstances account for much of the stagnation - especially the depression of the thirties and the Second World War - Preventing the Future argues that the situation was aggravated by internal circumstances. The key domestic factor was the failure to extend higher and technical education and training to larger sections of the population. This derived from political stalemates in a small country which derived in turn from the power of the Catholic Church, the strength of the small-farm community, the ideological wish to preserve an older society and, later, gerontocratic tendencies in the political elites and in society as a whole. While economic growth did accelerate after 1960, the political stand-off over mass education resulted in large numbers of young people being denied preparation for life in the modern world and, arguably, denied Ireland a sufficient supply of trained labour and educated citizens. Ireland\'s Celtic Tiger of the nineties was in great part driven by a new and highly educated and technically trained workforce. The political stalemates of the forties and fifties delayed the initial, incomplete take-off until the sixties and resulted in the Tiger arriving nearly a generation later than it might have.',1235,'2015-05-15 10:58:22','2005-09-01','1235.jpg','0717139700','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Preventing-Future-Tom-Garvin/dp/0717139700/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431687015&sr=1-1&keywords=tom+garvin',0,1,0,0,352,'978-0717139705','','',1,0.0000,'',''),('1922: The Birth of Irish Democracy','Tom  Garvin','892','Gill & McMillan','http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/','history',2,'Dublin ','This book examines the birth of the Irish state, and sets it in its European historical context. The process of democratic nation-making reached full fruition, while a vicious civil war was raging, ostensibly fought over points of political principle but actually deciding, whether Ireland was to be ruled by popular majority will or by a virtuous but unaccountable minority. Garvin argues that militant republicanism always lacked popular, democratic legitimacy. The mainstream Irish nationalist tradition was moderate and realistic, and it was this nation-building tradition that triumphed in 1922. The stability and good order of the Irish state owes much to this victory. In particular, because the democratic impulse in Irish life overcame the cult of the virtuous minority, Ireland did not go the way of so many other newly emerging European states. There were to be no military dictators or fascist interludes; instead, there evolved a stable democracy which eventually came to include most of those defeated in 1922.',1236,'2015-05-15 11:04:18','2005-09-01','1236.jpg','','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/1922-Birth-Democracy-Tom-Garvin/dp/0717139697/ref=sr_1_sc_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431687686&sr=1-2-spell&keywords=tm+garvin',0,1,0,0,258,'978-0717139699','','English',1,0.0000,'',''),('Handbook to Lisdoonvarna and Its Vicinity ','Philip  Dwyer','',' Clare Local Studies Project (CLASP Press)','http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/library/local-studies/clasp/','History',2,'Co.

From poetry composed by anonymous monks in early Christian monasteries through to the modern masters, the tradition of Irish verse has sustained and renewed itself in every generation. Forgotten Beauty presents in gift book form poetry chosen with care and affection. It focuses on the better-known and most popular poems of the major writers, but every reader will also find hidden delights and surprises.

The poetry is complemented by appropriate paintings from the Irish fine art tradition, one that is often unfairly relegated to a minor place in critical judgements. The excellence of the poetry in this book speaks for itself. The paintings, many by contemporary artists, are, however, an integral part of Forgotten Beauty, and demonstrate that there is another Irish artistic tradition which, although not as celebrated as its poetry, can claim excellence in its own right.',164,'2015-02-17 19:46:03','2014-10-03','164.jpg','0717157792','Writer and artist Brian Lalor headed a team of nine hundred contributors as General Editor of The Encyclopaedia of Ireland (2003), which won the Association of American University Presses award for best reference work in the humanities, and the American Library Association listing as best single volume work of reference.

In fact the only once that anybody could remember getting a mention in a national newspaper was when it was referred to as “the sleepy village of Ballymona”. \r\nOh but how all this was to change over those few years from 1980, when both internal and external events set such an explosive combination in place that it rocked the ancient village to its very foundation. \r\nThe simple love of the game of hurling and the pride it brought it every parish in Ireland was the catalyst which caused conflicts and splits that were never likely to be healed The past history of the team came back to haunt those who had tried to forget. The bloodlines of the proposed new team were still the same and old habits die hard. \r\nVisitors looked on the tidy village, with its picturesque church and restful lake out the road as the idyll what a tranquil place might be. But Ballymona had an underbelly shifting back and forth just under the surface. The forces of passion and conquest competed for space whenever there was the slightest vacuum. \r\nOld hurler Danny Mahon didn’t want much of anything else; but he was driven by a determination to reinvent the great hurling team that he played his last game at a forty-something year old some sixteen years earlier.

The phrase \"Banksters\" is resurrected as David Murphy and Martina Devlin describe the shocking story of how the Irish banking system was brought to its knees by a corrupt elite driven by profit and greed.Banksters examines the events which triggered the near collapse of Ireland\'s banking system, when it unfolded that a privileged \'golden circle\', caught up in a frenzy of greed and opportunism, had gambled and lost with the deposits and pensions of the Irish people.It charts how an unprecedented orgy of over-borrowing - fuelled by bankers who threw out the rule book on lending and reckless tax breaks from cavalier politicians -caused a massively over-inflated property bubble. While bank shares climbed to dizzying heights, profits soared and executives earned enormous bonuses, those who cried \'stop!\' were shouted down. But there was no promised \'soft landing\' when, in September 2008, bankers overnight went from being pillars of society to pariahs. When the word \'Ireland\' became synonymous with corruption in the global lending markets. When a generation learned it would pay a high price for the arrogance and greed of its business elite.\r\n\r\nBanksters is a hard-hitting read that, were it fiction, might not be believed. In describing the key players, their motivations, personalities and lavish lifestyles it poses the all-important questions: who is answerable - and will all the culprits be called to account?',1576,'2015-08-20 08:23:37','2009-05-22','1576.jpg',' 0340994827','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Banksters-David-Murphy/dp/0340994827/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440058634&sr=1-1&keywords=banksters',0,1,0,0,320,'978-0340994825','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Even Better Than the Real Thing',' Martina Reilly','','Hachette Ireland','http://www.hachette.ie/BookDetail.aspx?Id=257757','Fiction',11,'Dublin','When steady, dependable artist Eve Cole finds herself sitting by a pool in Florida with an ex-conman, hatching a plan to steal back a painting reportedly worth eleven million euro, she has to ask herself how the hell she wound up here.\r\n\r\nHer life has always been ordered, safe, predictable.

Born in Dublin in 1917 to politically active parents, Maeve Brennan\'s childhood in Ireland was moulded by the cultural ideologies of nationalism and lit by the creative energy of the Abbey and Gate theatres. She was seventeen when her father was appointed to the Irish Legation in Washington DC, where he was Irish Minister throughout World War II. Maeve wrote fashion copy at Harper\'s Bazaar until 1949, when William Shawn invited her to join The New Yorker.

Her richly textured fiction criticism and \'Talk of the Town\' pieces, published in the 1950s and \'60s, during The New Yorker\'s most influential period, offer unsparing portraits of the Ireland she had left and the America she inhabited.

An Irish War of Independence volunteer, anti-Treaty republican and graduate of the International Lenin School in Moscow, Murray rooted himself in the key Irish labour, republican and international struggles of his time. Based on previously unseen archival sources, Seán Byers explores Murray s IRA activities during the Irish revolutionary period; his significant contribution to the 1932 outdoor relief strike and the short-lived republican Congress initiative; and his crucial role in organising the Irish contingent of the International Brigade who fought with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. Shining a spotlight on Murray\'s close personal and political relationships with Peadar O Donnell, Frank Ryan, Jim Larkin junior, Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, Betty Sinclair and many others, Byers uses this biography as a nexus for examining cross-pollination between the Irish socialist and left republican movements throughout the period in question.

Re-asserting the event as first and foremost a human drama - in which tragedy, brutality, confusion and even moments of black comedy were played out against a city in flames - \"The 1916 Rising\" adds up to the most comprehensive and accessible account of \"Easter Week\" in print. The book is an expanded version of the supplement that appeared in \"The Irish Times\" in March 2006. The supplement, which was published in association with the Department of Education and Science, was received with praise in all quarters - a remarkable achievement in view of the historical controversy that still surrounds the Rising.

This turn of events teaches her that you must love people they way they are and not how you would want them to be. \r\n\r\nSet in Dublin and the Irish countryside, the story is brimming with fun, food, fashion and frolics all the way to its romantic conclusion.\r\n',582,'2015-03-02 16:07:44','2010-12-02','582.jpg','','','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Susanne-OLeary/e/B00A7U0SGY/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Silver-Service-Irish-romantic-comedy-ebook/dp/B004EYT3L0/ref=sr_1_452?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425311076&sr=1-452&keywords=irish+fiction',0,0,1,0,186,'','B004EYT3L0','English',43,0.0000,'',''),('Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code ',' Eoin Colfer','13','Puffin; Re-issue edition ','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Artemis-Fowl-Eternity-Code-Colfer/dp/014133911X/ref=sr_1_456?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425311076&sr=1-456&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code is the third book in the unbelievably brilliant Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfe',584,'2015-03-02 16:12:12','2011-04-07','584.jpg','014133911X','','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eoin-Colfer/e/B001JS4V8E/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1','amazon.co.uk','http://www.puffin.co.uk/',0,1,0,0,368,'978-0141339115','','English',43,0.0000,'',''),('Are You Listening Rabbi Löw','J.

The clear winners have been the middle-aged Jagger Generation, enormously enriched by the property boom, while the younger generation – the cash-stripped Jugglers – will be badly exposed as the credit wave recedes.\r\n\r\nThen there are the Bono Boomers, wedged between the winners and losers, who are not about to grow up just because the economy is doing badly, preferring instead to enjoy life as permalescents – a permanently adolescent generation, too young to be old, too old to be hip.\r\n\r\nAs the Jaggers, Jugglers and Bono Boomers struggle to maintain their slice of a diminished pie, David McWilliams explains how it\'s time to take stock, learn from history and harness the collective power of past generations. He argues that if Ireland can exploit its unique economic resource – it\'s global tribe – Ireland as a nation will be reinvigorated.

The city lies under the dark cloud of the Troubles, and hatred fills the air like smoke. But Tony Macaulay has just turned twelve and he’s got a new job. He’s going to be a paperboy. And come rain or shine – or bombs and mortar – he will deliver…\r\n\r\nPaperboy lives in Upper Shankill, Belfast, in the heart of the conflict between Loyalists and Republicans. Bombings are on the evening news, rubble lies where buildings once stood, and rumours spread like wildfire about the IRA and the UDA.\r\n\r\nBut Paperboy lives in a world of Doctor Who, Top of the Pops and fish suppers. His battles are fought with all the passion of Ireland’s opposing sides – but against acne, the dentist and the ‘wee hoods’ who rob his paper money. On his rounds he hums songs by the Bay City Rollers, dreams about outer space and dreams even more about the beautiful Sharon Burgess.\r\n\r\nIn this touching, funny and nostalgic memoir, Tony Macaulay recounts his days growing up in Belfast during the Troubles, the harrowing years which saw neighbour fighting neighbour and brother fighting brother. But in the midst of all this turmoil, Paperboy, a scrappy upstart with a wicked sense of humour and sky-high dreams, dutifully goes about his paper round. He is a good paperboy, so he is.\r\n\r\nPaperboy proves that happiness can be found even in the darkest of times; it is a story that will charm your socks off, make you laugh out loud and brings to life the culture, stories and colourful characters of a very different – but very familiar – time.',1296,'2015-05-30 06:17:39','2011-11-24','1296.jpg','0007449232','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007449232/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i2?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0XV02ZA3VDAMK13RNXKH&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=577047927&pf_rd_i=desktop',0,1,0,0,288,' 978-0007449231','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Dublin Student Doctor, A (Irish Country Books) ','Patrick Taylor','676','Forge; Reprint edition','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dublin-Student-Doctor-Irish-Country/dp/0765326744/ref=sr_1_622?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425404914&sr=1-622&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','Patrick Taylor\'s devoted readers know Doctor Fingal Flahertie O\'Reilly as a pugnacious general practitioner in the quaint Irish village of Ballybucklebo.

It takes the Irish story from the 1920s right through to the present, providing an excellent case study of one of many European states which obtained independence during and after the First World War. The book covers the transition to protectionism and import substitution between the 1930s and the 1950s and the second major transition to trade liberalisation from the 1960s. In a wider European context, the Irish experience since EEC entry in 1973 was the most extreme European example of the achievement of industrialisation through foreign direct investment. The eager adoption of successive governments in recent decades of a neo-liberal economic model, more particularly de-regulation in banking and construction, has recently led the Republic of Ireland to the most extreme economic crash of any western society since the Great Depression.',1284,'2015-05-28 07:24:10','2015-05-27','1284.jpg','0415566940','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Economic-History-Independence-Routledge-Economics/dp/0415566940/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1432797247&sr=1-1',1,0,0,0,304,'978-0415566940','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Chisellers','Brendan O\'Carroll','223','The O\'Brien Press; 2 edition','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chisellers-Brendan-OCarroll/dp/1847173233/ref=sr_1_664?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425448582&sr=1-664&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','t\'s three years since Redser\'s death and Agnes Browne soldiers on, being mother, father and referee to her fighting family of seven.

With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that was identified closely with British rule, her interest in the language and the legends of the local area was fostered early in her life by her nanny. After the death of her husband, her interest in the language and folklore was re-ignited. Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the Irish Literary Revival. Many of the diaries and journals she kept for most of her adult life have been published, providing a rich source of information on Irish literary history during the first three decades of the 20th century. This edition of Lady Gregory’s A Book of Saints and Wonders is specially formatted with a Table of Contents and pictures.

But she also lost her marriage and her dreams of being a mother. \r\n\r\nThe Hollow Heart is the story of Martina\'s journey from early bewilderment at being diagnosed as infertile, through the traumatic and demanding process of IVF, to the shattering fall-out when it failed. And she realized that not only would she never have children, but that somewhere along the way her relationship with her husband had been damaged beyond repair. \r\n\r\nBut Martina also describes how her despair eventually faded. How she made a new life for herself. And how she learned to take pleasure in her extended family of nieces and nephews. Most of all, The Hollow Heart is the story of a woman learning to do as her mother always advised - to count her blessings. \r\n',1578,'2015-08-20 08:39:37','2014-10-27','1578.jpg','','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hollow-Heart-womans-desire-destroyed-ebook/dp/B00OYXN45C/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8',0,0,1,0,272,'','B00OYXN45C','English',1,1911.0000,'0',''),('Gearrscéalta an Chéid','Gearóid Denvir, Aisling  Ní Dhonnchadha','',' Clo Iar-Chonnacht','https://www.cic.ie/','fiction',11,'Ireland','This volume contains 20 of the best short stories written in Irish in the last century, edited by Gearoid Denvir, lecturer in Modern Irish in NUIG, and Aisling Ni­ Dhonnchadha, lecturer in Modern Irish in NUI Maynooth.\r\n',1028,'2015-03-06 10:02:25','2000-06-01','1028.jpg','','This book is in the Irish language not in English as stated in the description.','','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gearrsc%C3%A9alta-Ch%C3%A9id-Gear%C3%B3id-Denvir-ebook/dp/B0093L5DZO/ref=sr_1_987?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425633974&sr=1-987&keywords=irish+fiction',0,0,1,0,282,'','B0093L5DZO','English',41,0.0000,'0',''),('The Element of Fire',' Brendan Graham','','HarperCollins; New Ed edition ','http://www.harpercollins.com/','fiction',11,'Ireland','From the author of the acclaimed The Whitest Flower comes the story of an unforgettable heroine, Ellen Rua O’Malley.

Above all, there was my mother’s own struggle with her growing doubts about God and the afterlife – she who had once been the Pope’s representative in Battersea.’\r\n\r\nEvery sentence Walsh writes is witty, outrageous, illuminating and compelling; he explores the Irish identity in a warm, personal and confessional book that takes in issues of race, of place, of language, of song, of love, of religion and, crucially, the changing nature of Ireland as it wriggles out of the dwindling influence of the church towards a new sense of itself; and in England, Irish culture has a fashionable ascendency (Angela’s Ashes, Father Ted) as indeed it always has had.\r\n\r\nStuffed like a barmbrack (fruitcake to you English) with quotations from Heaney, MacNeice, the Pogues and Paul Muldoon, it will be intensely personal, lively rather than gloomy, full of literary and historical relish, and a completely glorious read.\r\n',1066,'2015-03-06 14:13:51','2011-06-10','1066.jpg','0006531229','The book is probably the best perspective ever of an in depth first hand analysis of middle class Anglo Irish relations in the 60\'s 70\'s and 80\'s, and possibly even prior to this.','','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falling-Angels-John-Walsh/dp/0006531229/ref=sr_1_1032?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425650458&sr=1-1032&keywords=irish+fiction',0,1,0,0,304,'978-0006531227','','English',41,0.0000,'0',''),('Screwed',' ','','Headline','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Screwed-Eoin-Colfer/dp/0755391888/ref=sr_1_1037?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425651457&sr=1-1037&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','From the bestselling author of the Artemis Fowl children\'s titles comes a brilliant, darkly comic follow-up to the adult crime debut PLUGGED\r\n',1071,'2015-03-06 14:29:41','2013-09-12','1071.jpg','0755391888','I remember watching the Robert DeNiro/Charles Grodin movie Midnight Run when it first came out and looking at my watch after about an hour and a half and thinking: ','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eoin-Colfer/e/B001JS4V8E/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Screwed-Eoin-Colfer/dp/0755391888/ref=sr_1_1037?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425651457&sr=1-1037&keywords=irish+fiction',0,1,0,0,368,'978-0755391882','','English',41,0.0000,'0',''),('The Things I\'ve Seen','Lara Marlowe','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com','Non-fiction',19,'Ireland, France, Middle East, Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine and Iraq.

Originally published in 1998, to great success, this new and revised edition brings original scholarship to contemporary readers and contains an insightful added essay on Joyce\'s aesthetic musings. In his foreword, the internationally renowned Coleridge scholar J. C. C. Mays praises the original essays by Eco and Santoro-Brienza for being both highly respectful of Joyce and for their friendly familiarity with him. Mays also notes that \'These commentaries, by Italians in English, of an author of books in English who preferred to speak Italian, are a rich and illuminating conjunction. Read these lectures for the way they are, for they brings together two worlds. Their eminent authors do not stand on dignity: they communicate directly what is important. They have different things to say, but each celebrates values which Joyce held most dear.\'The addition of Santoro-Brienza\'s new essay also gives readers a fresh insight into Eco\'s unique contribution to our understanding of Joyce, Aquinas and aesthetics, and was written in honour of Eco\'s eightieth birthday. This volume brings to light fascinating aspects of Ireland\'s most famous literary figure and places him in a wider cultural context.

She\'s right, and with her mother sick and her half-sister Annie becoming increasingly feckless, it\'s down to Ellen to fight Conor\'s tyranny. But when Annie disappears, leaving her baby on their doorstep, Ellen begins fear for herself and for the life of the innocent child she has learnt to love...',1113,'2015-03-06 16:52:03','2001-03-05','1113.jpg','0747263655','','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lyn-Andrews/e/B000AQ1PY4/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Sisters-Child-Lyn-Andrews/dp/0747263655/ref=sr_1_1091?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425660268&sr=1-1091&keywords=irish+fiction',0,1,0,0,448,' 978-0747263654','','English',41,0.0000,'0',''),('Inventing Ireland: The Literature of a Modern Nation: Literature of the Modern Nation ',' Declan Kiberd','','Vintage; New Ed edition ','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inventing-Ireland-Literature-Modern-Nation/dp/009958221X/ref=sr_1_1092?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425660268&sr=1-1092&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','INVENTING IRELAND is the most ambitious critical history of modern Irish literature to have been published for many years.

This book relates the ancient act of ploughing to the modern world in often humorous ways, ensuring this nostalgic book will appeal to everybody, and not just those with an active interest in ploughing. The art and science of ploughing has helped put food on the tables of millions of people in Ireland and across the world for thousands of years. \r\n\r\nThe fascinating world of ploughing has it all: amazing people, beautiful horses, mesmerising machinery, and stars such as Harry Ferguson from County Down and his enemy (and later friend) Henry Ford. Plough Music covers the whole gamut of ploughing, from the hills of Ballycullane to the banks of the Brahmatputra, and from the near-miraculous role played by the humble earthworm in aerating the soil, attempting to create plough-free farming. \r\n\r\nWhy do 150,000 people attend the national ploughing championships each year? Why do hundreds of old-boy racers regularly take their vintage tractors out on the roads? And why do multimillionaires forsake their yachts and foreign holidays to take to the plough? Now, for the first time, writer and journalist David Medcalf, a lifetime observer of rural families and their way of life, sheds light on these and other burning questions. His miscellany of musings will fascinate, educate, intrigue and illuminate both the dedicated ploughman (or woman) and the armchair follower of this ancient art. It is a feast for both the mind and the soul; it is music for tired souls, inextricably entwined with our national identity.\r\n',1741,'2015-09-01 08:23:59','2015-09-01','1741.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/plough-music-sketches-secrets-and-stories',0,0,0,0,0,'9781905483785','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('Little Lamb ','Joseph Black ','520','','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Lamb-Joseph-Black-ebook/dp/B00MTZEIJI/ref=sr_1_1122?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425666653&sr=1-1122&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','From Joseph Black, the author of Happy Little Pig, comes another tale of the darker side of human nature\r\n',1140,'2015-03-06 18:35:50','2014-08-17','1140.jpg','','This is a good, short, hard hitting cannibal story.Not for the easily offended.','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Joseph-Black/e/B00MU650KM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Lamb-Joseph-Black-ebook/dp/B00MTZEIJI/ref=sr_1_1122?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425666653&sr=1-1122&keywords=irish+fiction',0,0,1,0,12,'','B00MTZEIJI','English',41,NULL,'',''),('Irish Short Stories ',' Sigerson Clifford','','Mercier Press','http://www.mercierpress.ie/','fiction',11,'Ireland','The short stories collected here are among the best ever written about Ireland, set apart by Sigerson Clifford\'s concise, masterful treatment of themes such as unrequited love, murderous hatred, betrayal, disappointment and hope.

Sport and Ireland demonstrates that there are aspects of Ireland\'s sporting history that are uniquely Irish and are defined by the peculiarities of life on a small island on the edge of Europe. What is equally apparent, though, is that the Irish sporting world is unique only in part; much of the history of Irish sport is a shared history with that of other societies. \r\n\r\nDrawing on an unparalleled range of sources - government archives, sporting institutions, private collections, and more than sixty local, national, and international newspapers - this volume offers a unique insight into the history of the British Empire in Ireland and examines the impact that political partition has had on the organization of sport there. Paul Rouse assesses the relationship between sport and national identity, how sport influences policy-making in modern states, and the ways in which sport has been colonized by the media and has colonized it in turn. \r\n\r\nEach chapter of Sport and Ireland contains new research on the place of sport in Irish life: the playing of hurling matches in London in the eighteenth century, the growth of cricket to become the most important sport in early Victorian Ireland, and the enlistment of thousands of members of the Gaelic Athletic Association as soldiers in the British Army during the Great War. Rouse draws out the significance of animals to the Irish sporting tradition, from the role of horse and dogs in racing and hunting, to the cocks, bulls, and bears that were involved in fighting and baiting.',2144,'2015-12-11 15:51:19','2015-12-12','2144.jpg','0198745907','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Sport-Ireland-History-Paul-Rouse/dp/0198745907/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1449848495&sr=1-2-fkmr0&keywords=The+Sweeney+Guide+to+the+Irish+Turf+from+1501-2001',1,0,0,0,400,'978-0198745907','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Short Stories: English and Irish Authors Read Their Own Work (The spoken Word)',' ','','The British Library Publishing Division ','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-Stories-English-Authors-spoken/dp/0712351108/ref=sr_1_1179?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425711993&sr=1-1179&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','In the years after the Second World War the BBC invited some of the leading British and Irish writers of short stories to read selected works of their own on the radio.

Characteristically rich in the moods and rhythms of the poet’s western Irish homeland, it is also drawn farther afield, towards contemplation of the disasters of previous centuries, their ‘many victories, many collars, little grace’. ‘What shift of bedrock, what metamorphosis,’ asks the poet, ‘might heal such wounded, wounding ground?’ An answer is sought in the conversation – the conversion – between politics and ecology: precise, shell-like meditations on the natural world – snow drops and almond blossom, nights of summer thunder – are described with the same humane, delicate energy as warzones and prison camps. Between these extremes, and balanced by them, Homer and Achilles, Shakespeare and Cromwell, ‘cattle-herders, butter-makers, singers, dancers’ live out their ‘sliver of the earth’s time’ by the same equalizing measure of mountains and forests, ‘the gold-struck, mercury sea’. The collection unifies these pasts in the symbolic curia of the museum and library, from where so many of Cannon’s poems take wing, pursuing objects beyond their material presence into their haunted pasts, objects that, to paraphrase the collection’s closing poem, ‘we have often seen before but have never heard’.',1610,'2015-08-26 11:45:12','2015-09-25','1610.jpg','','','','Carcanet Press','http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784100605',0,1,1,0,72,'978 1 784100 60 5','9781784100629','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Wild Irish Girl (Oxford World\'s Classics) ',' Lady Morgan  Sydney (nee Owenson)','','Oxford Paperbacks; New Ed. / edition','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Irish-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199552495/ref=sr_1_1187?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425714000&sr=1-1187&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','When Horatio, the son of an English lord, is banished to his father\'s Irish estate as punishment for gambling debts and dissipated living, he adopts the persona of knight errant and goes off in search of adventure.

Instead, let’s welcome all our feelings of distress, all our thoughts and beliefs about life’s challenges, and focus on transforming these in a way that is helpful for us.’\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable book Dr Claire Hayes demonstrates how each of us can use cognitive behavioural principles to help us cope. In a very clear, practical way she shows us how to make sense of our distressing feelings, to become aware of our unhelpful thoughts and our core beliefs, and most of all, to focus on what we can actually do to improve things for ourselves. Rather than trying to suppress or ignore our feelings of distress, she invites us to welcome them as messengers asking us to do something helpful to improve things.\r\n\r\nUsing her unique techniques such as the ‘Coping Triangle’ and ‘Coping Sentences’, Dr Hayes shows us how to proactively manage life’s challenges, such as pressure, rejection, loss, failure, success and change. A number of case studies illustrate the success of Dr Hayes’s approach, while practical exercises and advice make it accessible to all readers.

This scholarly and accessible new perspective contains the myth within the facts. Lemass was responsible for not one, but two economic revolutions during his time as Minister for Industry and Commerce. He steered the beginning of a long process that transformed Ireland from an agrarian province of Britain to a confident, developed country which has been seen as a model for many aspirant small nations. Among his innovations, Lemass instigated a new era in North-South relations and began the overhaul of the educational system. In \'Judging Lemass\', renowned historian, Tom Garvin, introduces the many facets of Sean Lemass - a cusp figure who ushered in the modern world; a visionary who was imagining a United States of Europe, since the 1920s; a sharp dresser with a striking film noir style and a preference for Cuban cigars; an ex-revolutionary who lost two younger brothers to the conflict; a proud urbanite who regarded rural Ireland as somewhat alien and agriculture as a drag on economic development; and, above all, the architect of modern Ireland. Reproduced alongside the text in a tactile print quality are letters, state documents and a store of unseen photographs.

This book analyses the social origins of the revolutionary politicians who became the rulers of Ireland after 1922 and examines their political preconceptions, ideologies and prejudices. Tom Garvin argues that in many cases they were not only influenced by old agrarian grievances or memories of the Famine, but also, and more immediately, by the contemporary Catholic abhorrence of the Protestant and secular world symbolised by London, England and, to some extent, America. Drawing on the evidence of private letters and diaries as well as the popular nationalist journalism of the period, \"Nationalist Revolutionaries in Ireland\" makes a hugely original contribution to Irish historiography. It reconstructs the private thoughts behind the public faces of the emergent leadership of independent Ireland, and also puts that leadership in comparative international perspective. This book, a classic of its type, now appears for the first time in paperback. It demonstrates all of Tom Garvin\'s intellectual and interpretative daring, his willingness to address major political and historical issues in a wholly original and thought-provoking way and his search for historical trails ignored by others.',1238,'2015-05-15 11:44:12','2005-09-01','1238.jpg',' 0717139689','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nationalist-Revolutionaries-Ireland-1858-1928-Garvin/dp/0717139689/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431690042&sr=1-4&keywords=tom+garvin',0,0,0,0,210,'978-0717139682','','English',1,0.0000,'',''),('Undoing Time: The Life and Work of Samuel Beckett ','Jennifer Birkett','896','Irish Academic Press','http://irishacademicpress.ie/','biography',6,'Dublin, Foxrock, Leopardstown.','Since his death in 1989, it has become difficult to imagine that Samuel Beckett was once a virtually unknown writer.

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.”\r\n\r\nSo begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank’s mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank’s father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible, and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father’s tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is story that accounts for Frank’s survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig’s head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance, and remarkable forgiveness.\r\n\r\nAngela’s Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt’s astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.',1291,'2015-05-28 23:39:59','1999-05-25','1291.jpg','068484267X','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.com/Angelas-Ashes-Memoir-Frank-McCourt/dp/068484267X',0,1,0,0,0,'978-0684842677','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Sean Keating: In Focus','Eimear  O\'Connor, Virginia  Teehan','','Associated Editions','http://www.associatededitions.ie/','art',1,'Dublin, Cork, ','This elegantly produced 64-page catalogue has been published to accompany the exhibition Sean Keating: In Focusat the Hunt Museum, Limerick.

Everybody who is anybody in gaelic games is here, as well as some less obvious candidates, from John O\'Mahony to John in the pub, from Angela Downey to that well-Known GAA fan Kyle Minogue, including Christy Ring, Ger Loughnane, Joe Brolly, Eamon O\'Hara, Joe Kernan, Babs Keating, Pat Spillane, Eamon Dunphy, Shane Curran and Garrett Fitzgerald.',1293,'2015-05-29 18:46:45','2015-05-28','1293.jpg','1782188398','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Breaking-Balls-Funny-Side-GAA/dp/1782188398/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1432924647&sr=1-1&keywords=breaking+balls',0,1,0,0,288,'978-1782188391','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Once Upon A Summer','Patricia  O\'Reilly','','Cape Press ','http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/about-us/about-us/companies/uk-companies-and-imprints/vintage-publishing/jonathan-cape','fiction',11,'Dublin, Fenit, Kerry','It is 1959.

Since then these subjects have rarely left the public mind. The nuns who worked in these institutions have been, for the most part, silent on these and other matters. This collective memoir presents the other side, the hidden life behind the convent walls. It is written from the perspective of a former nun who has unique insight into religious life and covers the period 1930 to 2008. In For God\'s Sake ten nuns recount their life stories. They come from all social strata and from different convents and congregations. They tell tales of a very repressive regime, of a strict social class system, of stifled emotions and of the harsh life in the Magdalen laundries and industrial schools. For many nuns the dreams of their young lives have been shattered by events beyond their control. Each story covers some aspects of convent life and the individual responses to it, and they offer some understanding of why nobody noticed the abuse, or if they did, why they turned a blind eye. These stories are important because they reveal a way of life that has long since passed, where every aspect of women\'s lives was governed by a male-dominated hierarchical Church that promised salvation, and even sainthood, to those who were faithful to its precepts. The nuns took vows and owed blind obedience to their superior who alone knew God\'s will, and in telling their stories finally become aware of many of the damaging effects the convent system had on their personalities.',1295,'2015-05-29 20:40:24','2015-05-29','1295.jpg','1908308648','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gods-Sake-Hidden-Life-Irish/dp/1908308648/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1432931564&sr=1-1&keywords=for+god%27s+sake',0,1,0,0,250,'978-1908308641','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('All Growed Up: What Breadboy Did at University','Tony  Macaulay','','Blackstaff Press','http://blackstaffpress.com/','fiction',11,'Belfast, Shankill, Coleraine','\'It\'s Belfast, 1982, and a seventeen-year-old boy wearing Hai Karate aftershave has an appointment with destiny.

As she recalls the inevitable tensions that arose when trying to juggle family life and a high-profile career, she tells of her struggle to combine the two contrasting aspects of her life. It was only through gritty determination, hard work and a fair amount of laughter that Mary was able to enjoy major success as an artist and, at the same time, raise a close and loving family with her husband Joe.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly honest, and written with warmth and humour, Down the Crooked Road offers a unique insight into the life and career of one of our most gifted singers – an artist who, during the course of her long career, has captured the hearts of millions around the world.',1316,'2015-06-02 17:48:45','2015-06-03','1316.jpg','1848271883','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Down-Crooked-Road-My-Autobiography/dp/1848271883/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433266873&sr=8-1&keywords=Down+the+Crooked+Road',0,0,0,0,336,'978-1848271883','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Hitler\'s Irish Voices: The Story of German Radio\'s Wartime Irish Service','David O\'Donoghue','','Somerville Press','http://www.somervillepress.com/','history',2,'Dublin, Berlin','This incredible story - based on detailed research in Germany, Ireland and Britain - uncovers for the first time one of the most sensitive issues concerning Irish-German relations in the Second World War. From December 1939 to May 1945, German Radio broadcast Nazi propaganda to neutral Ireland. From small beginnings featuring a weekly talk in Irish, the broadcasts from Berlin grew into a nightly bi-lingual service in Irish and English. The man behind the plan to target Irish listeners - as well as Irish groups in America and Australia - was Dr Adolf Mahr, the Austrian-born director of the National Museum in Dublin. A member of the Nazi Party, he was promoted to the top museum job in 1934. Mahr left Dublin in 1939, never to return. Officially on leave of absence from his job with the Irish Civil Service, he spent the war years in Berlin working on the Irish desk at the German Foreign Office, as well as establishing and directing German Radio\'s nightly Irish Service, known as the Irland-Redaktion. \"Hitler\'s Irish Voices\" tells the story of Mahr and the rest of his motley crew who worked for the Irland-Redaktion.\r\nIt traces their backgrounds, the various paths that led them to wartime Berlin, and tells what became of them after the war. The book examines in detail the reasons for the establishment of the radio service, what it broadcast, and who listened to it. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.',1317,'2015-06-03 06:41:32','2015-06-02','1317.jpg','1900960044','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hitlers-Irish-Voices-David-ODonoghue/dp/0992736404/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433313304&sr=1-1&keywords=Hitler%27s+Irish+Voices',0,1,0,0,254,'978-1900960045','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Penn','Sara  Berkeley','','Raven Arts Press','http://www.dermotbolger.com/raven.htm','poetry',23,'Dublin','Sara Berkely\'s debut collection of poems.

Tomás Ó Criomhthain\'s memoir an tOileánach (\"the Islandman\", 1929) and Robert J. Flaherty\'s documentary Man of Aran address similar subjects. The movement swiftly found itself the object of some derision and mockery – especially among the more cosmopolitan city dwellers of Ireland - for its often relentless depictions of rural hardship.

I have experienced much ease and much hardship from the day I was born until this very day.

For the combatants it was a no-holds-barred clash: the professional army of an empire against a highly motivated, well-drilled force of volunteers. What did the men and women who fought on the streets of Dublin endure during those brutal days after the clock struck on 24 April 1916? For them, the conflict was a mix of bloody fighting and energy-sapping waiting, with meagre supplies of food and water, little chance to rest and the terror of imminent attacks. The experiences recounted here include those of: 20-year-old Sean McLoughlin who went from Volunteer to Captain to Commandant-General in five days: his cool head under fire saved many of his comrades; volunteer Robert Holland, a sharpshooter who continued to fire despite punishing rifle recoil; Volunteer Thomas Young\'s mother, who acted as a scout, leading a section through enemy-infested streets; the 2/7th Sherwood Foresters NCO who died when the grenade he threw at Clanwilliam House bounced off the wall and exploded next to his head; 2nd Lieutenant Guy Vickery Pinfield of the 8th Royal Hussars, who led the charge on the main gate of Dublin Castle and became the first British officer to die in the Rising.

The book is divided into seven main chapters that focus on a specific period in the history of the language; they each begin with a discussion of the external history and position of the Irish language in the period, before moving on to investigate the important internal changes that took place at that time. A History of the Irish Language makes available for the first time material that has previously been inaccessible to students and scholars who cannot read Irish, and will be a valuable resource not only for undergraduate students of the language, but for all those interested in Irish history and culture.',1336,'2015-06-06 20:34:48','2015-06-06','1336.jpg','0198724764','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Irish-Language-Invasion-Independence/dp/0198724764/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433621708&sr=1-11&keywords=irish+art',0,1,0,0,320,'978-0198724766','','English',1,0.0000,'0','This books takes you close up to all the reasons why you spent years learning a language that was rarely used.

Cruelly beaten by bullies in the railway yard where he worked during his teens, he refused to fight back. Yet he went on to become a heavyweight boxing champion and to earn the \"undisputed reputation as the country\'s toughest and bravest garda.\" Chief Superintendent Edmund Doherty proclaimed him \"one of those people who become a legend in his own time.\" As a garda he refused to carry a baton, relying upon his fists. He took on the vicious \"animal gangs\" of the 1930s and 40s and in the \"Battle of Baldoyle\" broke their reign of terror. In the 1950s he quelled the wild \"rock-and-roll riots\" and tamed the ruffian Teddy Boys with their flick-knives. All the while, he was dealing with Dublin\'s full array of gurriers and criminals. As a devotee of American Western films and books, Branigan emulated the sheriffs by doling out his unique \"showdown\" brand of summary justice to hooligans and thugs on the street. In the 1960s his riot squad with its Garda \"posse\" patrolled Dublin\'s roughest districts in their \"black Maria.\" They contended with the most dangerous rows and riots in the streets, dancehalls and pubs. The cry \"Lugs is here!\" could instantly scatter a disorderly crowd. Ironically, for all his fame as a tough, fearless garda, he was most beloved for his humanity and compassion. His role as guardian of the battered women of the tenements and as protector and father figure of the city\'s piteous prostitutes-or \"pavement hostesses,\" as he called them-was unrecorded in the press and hushed up by the Garda brass. Yet, Garda John Collins vouches, \"Women ...oh, he was God to them!\" Upon retirement he entered his \"old gunfighter\" years; ageing and vulnerable, he became a target for old foes bent on revenge and for \"young guns\" seeking a quick reputation. His is a tale of extraordinary courage and compassion, and this untold part of his story is long overdue.

What turned a natural disaster into a human disaster was the determination of senior British officials to use relief policy as an instrument of nation-building in their oldest and most recalcitrant colony. Well-meaning civil servants were eager to modernise Irish agriculture and to improve the Irish moral character, which was utterly lacking in the virtues of the new age of triumphant capitalism.

Its main focus is on the 1920-70 period, when Irish film censors banned 3,000 films and cut an additional 10,000.\r\n\r\nThe role of political censorship and its effect on television and cinema is examined, as are the more contemporary issues of video classification and debates around the Internet and child pornography.

It is the first book on the subject and concentrates on the parks documented in the period 1169 to c.1350. Drawing on archaeological fieldwork, historical and place-name evidence, it generates a broad understanding of the role of parks in medieval society. It stresses the importance of the landscape and of the deer, cattle and timber within it as integral aspects of the material culture of high-medieval Ireland. The research is underpinned by extensive fieldwork, which has identified surviving park features in the landscape. Key topics explored include the form and function of medieval parks, their occurrence and location in the landscape, the status and identity of their owners and a comparison with parks elsewhere. Notably, the evidence suggests that both parks and fallow deer were relatively uncommon in Ireland compared to England. The reasons for this lie in chronology, landscape and politics, and these form a major theme within the book.',1366,'2015-06-09 09:07:57','2015-06-09','1366.jpg',' 1846825695','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Anglo-Norman-Parks-Medieval-Ireland-Beglane/dp/1846825695/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433840528&sr=1-1&keywords=Anglo-Norman+parks+in+medieval+Ireland',1,0,0,0,256,'978-1846825699','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Irish Culture and Wartime Europe, 1938-48','Guy Woodward','','Four Courts Publishing','http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/welcome/','history',2,'Dublin, Tullynally, Glencairn, Sanymount, North Strand, Irish Sea, Holyhead, Liverpool','The decade between 1938 and 1948 was a time of immense upheaval across Europe which deeply affected Irish writers and artists.

Taking these intersecting journeys as a starting point, the essays in this collection explore afresh the cultural history of this decade and the continuing impact of the events around and during the Second World War on Irish literature and culture.

This was swiftly followed by railway expansion throughout Ireland. In the south east it was the Dublin & South Eastern and the Great Southern & Western Railways that dominated. By 1925 they had amalgamated to become Great Southern Railways, but soon after there followed a period of fluctuating fortunes due to war and fuel shortages. In the 1950s competition from road transport led to drastic cost-cutting measures. Unlike the railways in Britain however, the region has enjoyed a revival since the 1980s with line electrifications and development of a modern tramway within the capital; as at date of publication there is now even an underground system being considered for the city. The whole history of the region\'s railways is told here in detail accompanied by a collection of 52 photographs.

The depth and range of James Joyce\'s relationship with key historical, intellectual and cultural issues in the early twentieth century are explored, including: the growth of Dublin as a city, the advance of Irish separatist nationalism, criminal trials in late nineteenth-century Ireland, the influence of Classical authors such as Aristotle and Ovid, the Irish Literary Revival, the value of operatic music, notions of the aesthetic and of a democratic readership, and the history and social import of Jewish communities and traditions. The twenty essays in this collection draw out the openness and pluralism of Joyce\'s writing and underscore the need for readings of his work from a large variety of diverging perspectives. The wide ranging voices in this collection are composed by present and former UCD academics, and constitute a unique reckoning with the legacy of Joyce by members of his alma mater.A portrait of Joyce emerges as a writer deeply embedded in Irish intellectual discourses and as a figure of vital on-going importance in the social and cultural debates of twenty-first century Ireland.

It demonstrates that during the eighteenth century sections of the educated elite backed away from witchcraft belief for largely ideological reasons, while the witch figure remained a strong part of popular culture.

As the map of Europe was being redrawn after 1918, Ireland too stood on the threshold of great change. The 1920s were a formative decade for Ireland, both north and south of the border, but is all too often dismissed as one of stagnation. In contract to this belief, the contributions to this important new collection provide a refreshingly alternative view of this significant decade, all serving to reignite the debate about how modern Ireland was defined and how statehood collided with national identities and allegiances. The relationship between government policy and the emerging state is explored in chapters focusing on Free State election posters, loyalty and treason, the 1923 Land Act, the Irish Farmers Party and parliamentary democracy. Other contributions look at how economic policy shaped the lives of ordinary Irish citizens and continue to have an impact today, long after Ireland s struggle for independence.',1403,'2015-06-18 15:06:39','2015-06-18','1403.jpg','0716532816','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Formative-Decade-Ireland-1920s/dp/0716532816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1434639614&sr=1-1&keywords=a+formative+decade',0,1,0,0,257,'978-0716532811','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('A Witch in a Fix ','Marian Broderick, Francesca  Carabelli','','O\'Brien Press','http://www.obrien.ie/','Childrens',12,'Dublin','Anna’s science teacher really gets on her nerves – but is that a good enough reason to turn her into a giant rat?\r\n\r\nWith a big, angry rat on the loose, Anna soon realises she’s made a bad mistake.

More savage than civilized, Noleen is a rare character from a Dublin long forgotten, where Nelson’s Pillar still stands in O’Connell Street?but not for long?and where untamed musicians gather in the O’Feeneys’ kitchen to raise a jar and the roof. Noleen’s father, a successful actor and scoundrel king of the city, does his best to destroy his family, while her mother tries to save it. Noleen schemes to make it through each Dublin day, cadging sweets and growing tough in the midst of chaos. In the end, however, nothing?not even a fierce girl’s powerful imagination?can hold the family together and keep them, safe as geese in the sky, in their home on Tolka Row.\r\n Smarty Girl is a wild child’s journey through a world alternately tender and brutal, humorous and heartbreaking, told in language as musical and vibrant as Dublin itself. \r\n \r\nHonor Molloy’s mother Yvonne is an American theatre director who sailed to Ireland in 1953 to study in Trinity College. Her father John was a seventh generation Dubliner and a local legend for his work on stage, in films and on television. Dedicated to capturing and preserving the Dublin vernacular, they worked together for fifteen years producing plays, radio, television shows …and six children. The life they led together---and the reasons that life had to end---provides the inspiration for their Smarty Girl.\r\n',1405,'2015-06-18 17:15:18','2015-06-19','1405.jpg','1936846101','','','Amazon.com','http://www.amazon.com/Smarty-Girl-Dublin-Honor-Molloy/dp/1936846101/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0BXHCRAG2GD7XSC9ADAT',0,1,0,0,240,'978-1936846108','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Ireland in the World: Comparative, Transnational, and Personal Perspectives ','Angela  McCarthy','','Routledge','http://www.routledge.com/','History',2,' Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Argentina, Jamaica, an','This international edited book collection of ten original contributions from established and emerging scholars explores aspects of Ireland’s place in the world since the 1780s.

Throughout his life from his relationship to his extraordinary mother Jane and the tragedy of his sister Isola\'s early death to his accomplished wife Constance and a coterie of other free-thinking writers, actors and artists, women were a central aspect of his life and career. Wilde\'s Women is the first book to tell the story of his female friends and colleagues who traded witticisms with Wilde but also give him access to vital publicity and whose ideas he gave expression through his social comedies. Author Eleanor Fitzsimons reframes Wilde\'s story and his legacy through the women in his life including such fascinating figures as Florence Balcombe who left him for Bram Stoker, actress Lillie Langtry (for a while an inseparable friend) and his tragic and witty niece Dolly who bore a strong resemblance to the writer and loved fast cars, cocaine and foreign women.

The scheme encircles the eastern side of Carlow town and represents the first phase of the new M9 motorway from Kildare to Waterford. The excavations afforded the opportunity to track changes in the local environment and landscape over the millennia, from the dense woodland of the Mesolithic era to the modern-day intensive agricultural landscape. Indirect evidence of Carlow’s earliest settlers in the Mesolithic era was recovered through the finding of stone tool sites, supplementing results of previous surveys along the Barrow river valley. The discovery of the earliest houses yet identified within the county attest to the presence of settled farming folk in the area during the Neolithic. A booming economy in the Bronze Age is manifest through the domestic, ritual and industrial sites of an extensive and complex cultural landscape. The route avoided upstanding medieval sites; however, archaeology relating to the hinterland of such sites affords intriguing insights into the rural life in the county during the medieval and post-medieval periods. The book is lavishly illustrated and provides the reader with a description in summary form of all the excavated sites.

Years later, on hearing his estranged father was now senile, Gebler made the journey to southern Ireland and through his past, through diaries that confirmed Ernest\'s hatred for his sons, yet also revealed the abuse Ernest in turn suffered as a young man, a life of extreme poverty and the abandonment of his first wife.

But most of all, he writes with verve and pace. Tony Ryan was born in a railwayman\'s cottage and rose to enormous success, overseeing the spectacular making of two business fortunes and the dramatic losing of one. After an early spell in Aer Lingus, he set up an airline leasing company, Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), which had its headquarters in Shannon and quickly became the largest such enterprise in the world. Ryan was a hard taskmaster and the company reflected his ferocious work ethic. Yet, despite a stellar board of directors, a botched and poorly timed Initial Public Offering in the 1990s saw GPA crash and burn. Ryan lost almost everything. What remained was a little airline that was chronically loss making. Ryan set about turning Ryanair around, putting in one of his assistants, Michael O\'Leary, to help knock it into shape. The rest is history. Ryan remade his fortune, lived lavishly and elegantly, was a generous patron of the arts, and in every respect larger than life. His spirit is one that Ireland needs more than ever today. As the nation strives for its own recovery, it can find inspiration in the story of how one of its most famous sons rose and fell, and then rose again. Not one to stand still or lament mistakes, Tony Ryan\'s determination never to give up is the real lesson of this story.

These include the ruined monastic buildings and cathedral buildings outside of Dublin, but also smaller parish churches that were being restored for reuse as places of worship, such as those at Adare, Co.

In addition to presenting the history of folklore collecting, this book also illustrates life in the Gaeltacht during the Second World War. Although best known as a piper, Ennis was a collector par excellence. This book is a personal account of his field work during those years. This is the first publication of a diary of a fulltime collector of music and song with the Irish Folklore Commission. It paints a vivid picture of social life at the time and comments in particular on popular pastimes and other aspects of daily life.A number of entries cast light on his fieldwork methodology, which was meticulous, and his attitude towards his mission, which led him to eschew anything that had been collected frequently or learned from a book. Ennis visited a number of Gaeltachtai and this book sketches a picture of life in Donegal, Mayo, Connemara and West Clare. This collection will have particular relevance not only to those interested in Ennis as an individual, but also to all historians and scholars of Irish traditional music and folklore in the twentieth century. Despite the great entertainment Ennis enjoyed on his working trips, he had to be ever vigilant, constantly on the look out for new material and new contacts from which to elicit information.Ui Ogain captures Ennis\' writing style admirably. Accounts of certain events reveal an engaged emotional intensity underscoring Ennis\' firm belief that his endeavour was more than a mere job. Such vignettes render the diary eminently accessible and attractive to a general reading public, a distinction rarely achieved in this kind of publication.

Some of the great enigmas of the past are now being unravelled, and this book gives a fascinating and fresh glimpse of how Ireland s unique and stunning ecosystem has evolved. The latest scientific theories, techniques and methods are used to bring readers up-to-date on each of these remarkable stories. Unravelling this history, as revealed through the chapters of this book, uses a wide array of evidence and clues, some ingenious; to build an amazing history that is part of all our pasts. The endeavours of humans whether in politics, art or territorial ambition are every bit as important as great ice-sheets, climatic catastrophes and even microscopic plant diseases in shaping and understanding this landscape of ours. The book also celebrates the pioneering work of Robert Lloyd Praeger. In 1895 Praeger began a pilgrimage across Ireland that was to last five years. His aim was to chart the distribution of all plants across the country. His observations of the landscape and its people became a classic of Irish travel writing in The Way That I Went. Praeger pondered the question of where the flora of Ireland come from, and conducted some of the greatest investigations into these matters with the Clare Island survey which was completed in 1913 this being its centenary year. Inspired by Praeger, modern experts are unravelling these stories using new techniques and methods, and bring together their recent findings to unravel the remarkable secrets of the Irish landscape.',1483,'2015-07-22 07:53:13','2015-07-22','1483.jpg','1782050108','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secrets-Irish-Landscape-Matthew-Jebb/dp/1782050108/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437549595&sr=1-1&keywords=secrets+of+the+irish+landscape',1,0,0,0,244,'978-1782050100','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('A Life with Claw: The Peter Clohessy Story','Anna Gibson Steel','','Hero Books','','Biography',6,'Limerick, ','Peter Clohessy was the most inspirational and controversial figure ever to represent Ireland on a rugby field in modern times.\r\nIn his 15 years with Munster, and a memorable decade in green, Clohessy was known simply as The Claw - he was an enforcer and a leader, a man who refused to shirk in the face of even the most insurmountable odds.\r\n\r\nThe Claw is known as the toughest and the most ruthless figure ever to play for Ireland.

Recounting scenes from her childhood in Ulster, she paints a memorable and poignant picture of violence and oppression with her uncaring father and protective mother, whose retaliation to her husband’s penny-pinching came in the form of a secret yellow dress. \r\n\r\nChristina’s formative years and her foray into the world, which begin with the daily trudge to and from school, are peopled by a troupe of bizarre and unforgettable characters dancing in and out of her life, filling her with awe and wonder. Among them are Miss McKeague, a gentle, calm and graceful religious zealot, Great Aunt Rose, the “Yankees,” Norrie the transvestite, and in the wings, her stern, unyielding uncles, each vying for the ancestral money and land to the exclusion of all else.\r\n\r\nAt age eleven, she experiences a frightening paranormal occurrence, a prolonged haunting that confirms for her the reality of the spirit world. \r\n\r\nThough it affects her deeply, she later learns to channel her confusion into twin artistic passions: poetry and painting. The discordant nature of Christina McKenna’s young life, and the feelings of inferiority it bred, lead her to examine all the limiting belief systems she grew up with, and question the validity of the hidebound Catholicism of her childhood. \r\n\r\nThis is a rite-of-passage account of two generations of Irish women, told with great humour and compassion. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand is the writer; on the other the heroic mother who showed her love as best she could.

All translators have tackled the problem of being Irish poets working in English and drawing upon the Irish-language tradition in various ways, as well as having to negotiate between Merriman’s world and their own historical moments. This tension in translation is the major focus of The Midnight Court: Eleven Versions of Merriman.\r\n\r\nThe author sets out the problems of translation in an introductory chapter and gives a general note on the tradition of translating Merriman’s poem. He then focuses attention on eleven translators, who are given a chapter each for discussion: Denis Woulfe, Michael C. O’Shea, Arland Ussher, Frank O’Connor, Lord Longford, David Marcus, Patrick C. Power, Cosslett Ó Cuinn, Thomas Kinsella, Seamus Heaney and Ciaran Carson.\r\n\r\nAs the book progresses, a picture forms of a layering in the life of the translated poem as translators rescue overlooked themes or stylistic approaches.

This volume offers important perspectives on corruption theory. It argues that the definition of corruption is an evolving one. As the nature of the state changes, so too does the type of corruption. An incremental legal revolution, which emphasised individual rights instead of moral responsibilities, has occurred. The Irish party system, political culture and media influenced the character of Irish corruption. New evidence is presented on the early institutional development of the state. Irish public life was motivated by an ethos which rejected patronage and which sought to build a political framework on ethical foundations. Original archival research provides fresh insights into how the policies of economic protectionalism and discretionary decision making ultimately led to eight official Tribunal inquires into scandal. The emergence of state capture within political decision making is examined by analysing political favouritism towards the beef industry. Unorthodox links between political donations and business or personal interests was the principal cause of scandal. The degree to which this impacted on policy choices which exacerbated the depth of Ireland\'s economic collapse and necessitated intervention by the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in 2010 is considered. This book will appeal to students and scholars of Irish politics, corruption theory, governance, public policy and political financing.',1520,'2015-08-05 06:45:45','2015-08-05','1520.jpg',' 0719086884','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0719086884/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i9?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=desktop-2&pf_rd_r=01Z35Q92AZJ8RMSMQQ0C&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=577048407&pf_rd_i=desktop',0,1,0,0,224,'978-0719086885','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Destinations: Stories from the DART',' Sheila O\'Flanagan','','Headline Lir','','Fiction',11,'Dublin, Landsdowne Road, Sydney Parade, Booterstown, Blackrock, Tara Street, Bayside, Sutton, Howth','Destinations reveals the inside track on the lives of ordinary commuters, and uncovers the hidden links that lie beneath the surface of \'anonymous\' city lives.\r\n\r\nTwo eavesdropping passengers learn more than they bargained for; an office-party fling has unforeseen consequences; a suburban housewife is forced to face her estranged mother - and her thorny past; an office worker finds her commute to work livened up by the daily sightings of a handsome stranger; a hot date with the office stud gets off to a disastrous start ... is there light at the end of the tunnel?\r\n\r\nDestinations - tales that go the distance with you, from one of Ireland\'s best-loved storytellers.',1521,'2015-08-06 09:02:05','2003-07-03','1521.jpg','0755309030','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Destinations-Stories-DART-Sheila-OFlanagan/dp/0755309030/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1438851250&sr=1-2-fkmr0&keywords=dublin+off+the+dart',0,1,0,0,352,'978-0755309030','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('A Long Way from Tipperary: One family\'s journey through famine and war','Ralph  Murphy','','CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform','https://www.createspace.com/','Biography',6,'Gortnahoe, Tippeary, Nenagh, Ypres, Loos, Belgium, Bristol','This is the story of William Murphy and his ancestors who escaped from the Great Famine in Ireland in 1845 to work in the coalmines of South Wales.

Often working undercover and involved in all kinds of ‘dirty tricks’, he narrowly misses capture and death at the hands of his enemies. David’s life is complicated by his falling for a beautiful republican girl who is on the fringes of the IRA and is eventually driven out of Ulster by her Special Branch tormentors. The task though was “The collection, collation and dissemination of intelligence.” To this end David did everything from reading the newspapers to covertly photographing terrorist suspects, from interrogation and surveillance, to dirty tricks. Anything short of open criminality was acceptable. The fact that even his superiors often had little idea exactly what his role was, added to a feeling of freedom of action. A vivid description of the border war raged by the IRA, against the towns and villages of Counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, in the early seventies. It is a true story taken from the author’s firsthand experience with historically valuable photographic evidence. An unlikely and dangerous love story which took place during a major conflict, fought on our very own doorstep that to a great extent was won by intelligence and covert actions.

To remedy this, Hobbs and his team propose a new approach to regulate and tax this lucrative industry, so that Ireland can benefit from Irish resources.\r\n\r\nSeeking to emulate the Norwegian model of resource management, the book shows how we, as Irish citizens, can become empowered and regain control of our natural resources, demand a fair share of the profits and wisely allocate our gains. Own Our Oil: The Fight for Economic Freedom offers readers information on the latest developments in the international oil and gas arena and the potential economic upside of Ireland changing course and ‘getting it right’.

He was awarded a scholarship to St Paul\'s but chose not to enroll, returning with his family to Ireland where he earned a PhD from Trinity College by the age of twenty four, enjoying not only a successful academic career there but publishing a highly respected book on Isaac Butt. \r\n\r\nHe married in 1958 and went on to work as a broadcaster with RTE in the mid sixties, on TV programmes The Professors and Division before joining 7-Days (a predecessor to Prime Time) as a presenter. No longer content to fulfill a passive roll, he was elected as a Labour Party TD for the constituency of Dublin North-West in 1969, topping polls. He was then re-elected TD for Dublin North-West in 1973 with a reduced vote and served as a MEP for a further four years, before losing his seat in the 1977 election. He died in Dublin in June in 1978, his ambitions only partly realised.\r\n\r\nDavid\'s daughter Yseult has assembled a highly-respected coterie of people who knew, worked with and admired David Thornley and they contribute, here, assessments of his various careers, as well as providing valuable insights into this complex and gifted man who passed away before his time- now fondly remembered',1670,'2015-08-28 15:19:37','2015-08-28','1670.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/unquiet-spirit',0,0,0,0,0,'9781905483471','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('Painted With Words','Lara Marlowe','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com','Art',1,'Ireland','Along with her work as a foreign correspondent, Lara Marlowe is known for her writings on culture in The Irish Times.

He recounts his personal and professional relationships with such luminaries as Patrick Kavanagh, Allen Ginsberg and, as co-founder of Claddagh Records, with composer Seán Ó Riada. There is an interesting account of meeting Charles Haughey and a suggestion that a seed was sown that might have led ultimately to the introduction of the artist tax exemption. \r\n\r\nThe Pear is Ripe covers a period of great social change and upheaval internationally and, in particular, the north of Ireland. Montague\'s proximity to these changes, by accident or design, was to influence his work and lends this memoir an immediacy that belies the intervening years. \r\n\r\nWhile much of the book covers the writer\'s public and literary life, it also addresses the strain that living apart from his wife Madeleine placed on their marriage -- which would ultimately lead to their break-up. While the book principally spans the period from the mid-sixties to the late seventies, Montague has included a powerful and moving epilogue featuring more recent events. He writes of visiting young men with AIDS in a New York hospital, and of a final meeting with an ailing Samuel Beckett in Paris. \r\n\r\nPoetry Ireland director Joe Woods has spoken of the dearth of memoir by poets that may help to inform their work and its enjoyment.

As Caroline was unable to carry a baby to full term, the pair unsuccessfully explored IVF treatment and adoption, before finding a glimmer of hope through Dr Patel’s Infertility Clinic in India. To great celebration, they met the surrogate mother in August 2010 and following a successful embryo transfer, Ava was born in April 2011. However, when their heartache should have turned to joy, they met another battle… \r\nOn the basis that Ava was a surrogacy baby, the Irish Government refused to issue her a passport or emergency travel documents. The deficit of legislation governing surrogacy in Ireland, combined with the surrogate mother being considered the legal mother, left Caroline and Ava stranded in India in a legal limbo, with terrorism threats ripe in the wake of bin Laden’s death.\r\n\r\nThe issuing of Ava’s passport ultimately affected the status of surrogacy in Ireland: in February 2012, new guidelines were used by the Department of Justice to assist parents planning to have children via surrogate mothers abroad that allowed for the granting of travel documents. Caroline and Niall’s tale of surrogacy is brave and bitter-sweet, embracing the richness and diversity of Indian culture and the generosity of its people.

The area in which these disappearances occurred became publicly referred to as ‘The Vanishing Triangle\'. To date, none of the missing females have ever been located.\r\n\r\nThese six unsolved cases resulted in the creation of the specialist Garda task force \'Operation Trace\', set up in the hope of finding a connection between the missing women.

In almost half of the cases, the women\'s badly mutilated bodies were recovered, sometimes months later, buried in shallow graves.

Bardwell confronts her life head on, confessing bygone sins and exorcising old demons. However, despite the hardships of her life, this is far from a misery memoir, as A Restless Life celebrates the artistic, and often times anarchistic life of one of Ireland’s hidden, literary treasures.\r\n\r\nA young girl returns with her family from India to live in Leixlip, Co Kildare. For Leland Bardwell, like so many of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, the realities of life in the big house were far more modest and threadbare than appearances portrayed. A distant father and a temperamental mother left the awkward Leland to herself, and she spent much of her childhood disappearing into the countryside, smoking Afton cigarettes with pennies cadged from her father’s pockets. This itinerant and isolated existence becomes the template for much of her later life.\r\n\r\nLeland falls madly in love with her father’s cousin, a life-long obsession which derails her quiet solitude. An unplanned pregnancy brings her to a war-torn London, where her son is adopted. Accumulating lovers and children over the years she becomes a teacher in the highlands of Scotland, and a paper-seller on the street corners of Paris, before returning to Dublin. Here, she struggles to combine motherhood with artistic expression, as well as juggle her various affairs (both official and illicit).\r\n\r\nOstracised by her family, her tiny flat on Leeson Street becomes a refuge for writers, artists, eccentrics, and the drunken literary crew of McDaid’s pub.

Arising from the remnants of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin Metropolitan police, the embryonic club existed for forty years before being radically reconstituted in 1961. This was largely through the efforts of one man, Edmund (Ned) Garvey.\r\n\r\nFrom its Harrington Street premises, the Garda Club emerged as one of the top entertainment hotspots in Dublin in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The revenue generated from bingo, cabaret, Big Band dancing and disco, along with members\' subscriptions, made it possible for the club to embark on ambitious development plans. This culminated in the purchase of land in 1975 near Rathfarnham that would become Stackstown Golf Club.

In June 2010, thirty-eight years later, Lord Saville’s report made headlines all over the world, and the people of Derry were brought to a stunned silence as British Prime Minister David Cameron apologised on behalf of his government and his country for the ‘unjustified’ and ‘unjustifiable’ acts of Bloody Sunday. Setting The Truth Free is the first ever account of the remarkable Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign as told by the campaigners, relatives and the wounded themselves. Many books have been written on the subject but few mention in significant detail how these ordinary people achieved the impossible and unwittingly made history. Determined to clear their loved ones’ names, this group took on the might of the British government, and won.

It was the main topic of conversation in pubs, homes and workplaces as newspapers daily carried new and salacious details of the \"Black Widow\'s\" scheming, as well as images of her glamorous and expansive wardrobe, on their front pages. In the days before murders became a daily occurrence in Ireland, the allegations of contract killers, extra-marital affairs, fraud and involvement with Republican organisations seemed better suited to the big screen than a small town pub. \r\n\r\nPat Flynn led the investigation against Catherine, a woman whom he had encountered several times before these events unfolded. He had witnessed her fabricate accusations of sexual abuse against his Garda colleagues while she continued to enthral his superior officers and Judge O\'Buachalla. He describes how holes in her version of the events on the night of the murder were found, along with evidence of how she had been plotting for years to have her husband murdered. \r\n\r\nFlynn also reported Judge O\'Buachalla for granting Catherine the license for the pub solely in her name through irregular channels, after she had been charged with murder and as rumours of an affair between them had become rife. \r\n\r\nAlthough O\'Buachalla was discussed in the Dáil and a judicial investigation ordered, the results were never publicised, despite promises to the contrary from the then Minister for Justice, and the judge continued to sit in court.

Unlike most people, though, he left his home behind to make a bolt for those distant worlds and daring adventures. \r\n\r\nAfter one failed attempt to run away to join the British army, his second attempt succeeded, with him stowing away on the mail boat to Britain. Lying about his age, he was accepted into the army and, following his training, was posted to the strategically important island of Malta. The initial pleasures of the Mediterranean island and its beaches and entertainment areas gave way to the reality of unprecedentedly heavy air raids. \r\n\r\nHarte would later be transferred to Palestine, where he and his comrades were involved in several clandestine raids. Such activities ultimately saw Harte being selected for the elite Special Boat Service -- the forerunner of the SAS. Harte was captured, and many of his memoir\'s most amusing - and occasionally disturbing - episodes cover his internment as a prisoner of war in a German POW camp. \r\n\r\nPart coming-of-age memoir and part war story, Harte\'s remarkable, often funny tale reads like a novel and serves to remind us of the vital role played by Irish men and women in the Second World War. Limits of Endurance is a testament to the immutability of one man\'s spirit against extraordinary circumstance. Also included are previously unpublished photographs of the era.

Nearly everybody it seems, believer and non-believer alike, recalls what truly was a national event. More than a million people turned out to greet John Paul II at Phoenix Park, in the largest single gathering of people in Europe in modern times.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of young people heard him say the famous words \'Young people of Ireland, I love you\' at the Youth Mass in Galway, and large crowds gathered when the Pope visited Drogheda, Clonmacnoise, Maynooth, Knock and Limerick.

Many in the south believed that the governing body was heavily biased towards Ulster. Most internationals were played in Belfast, most players selected were from the North-East. With the country moving politically towards partition, soccer in Ireland was arguably affected more by the political environment than any other sport. As tensions rose between unionist and nationalist communities, soccer, with strong support bases in both communities, became embroiled in the conflict, playing host to many ugly sectarian incidents.Divisions in the sport reached a climax after the First World War, culminating in the split of 1921 when Leinster seceded from the IFA and formed the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).Making use of extensive primary sources from the IFA, FAI, the English FA and the Leinster Football Association as well as contemporary newspaper sources, The Irish Soccer Split details the events and causes that led to the split in soccer in Ireland.It compares soccer to other sports that remained or became united after partition. The Irish Soccer Split recounts the early years of the FAI and its attempts to gain international recognition. Many efforts were made to heal the division throughout the 1920s and the early 1930s. Efforts were renewed during the Troubles in the 1970s and 1980s to bring about an all-Ireland international team.

The simple fact is that as soon as any of us own property of any value, have children or enter a long term relationship -- personal or professional -- we need to make a will. \r\n\r\nMake Your Will is written in a clear, concise and jargon-free way by two long-standing experts in the area of succession and inheritance. This book takes the reader calmly and clearly through the process, and most importantly the systematic manner in which we should consider the provisions we make. Including sample wills taken from five real-life case studies to represent the various circumstances of Irish households: for example, married with children, widowed with property, unmarried siblings living together, this book aims to fully brief the reader on how to prepare, write and correctly finalise their will so that their wishes are clear and carried out after they pass away.',1749,'2015-09-01 08:57:45','2015-09-01','1749.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/make-your-will',0,0,0,0,0,'9781905483594','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('Inheritance and Succession: The Complete Irish Guide','Jason Dunne, John G.

Determined to become a doctor, he raised the money for medical school by smuggling cars from Germany to Turkey. While working in a hospital in Dublin in 1987, disaster struck: a needle he had used to draw blood from a patient with HIV jabbed him in the leg. Overwhelmed from the influx of emotion this propelled, he escaped to New Zealand, where he began a peripatetic existence, working as a doctor around the world, including Baghdad and Australia.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Dublin, Treacy set up the Ailesbury Clinic, where he worked on the cutting-edge of the new field of cosmetic dermatology, championing treatments such as the use of Botox.

This book includes images of the numerous examples of graffiti left on the walls of Kilmainham Jail by its political inmates from the War of Independence, Civil War and even further back in Irish history. \r\n\r\nKilmainham Jail housed many of Ireland\'s key historical flgures, from the 1798 rebellion right through to the Civil War; political prisoners who were proud to sacrifice their freedom for the cause they believed in. Many of them also left a physical mark on the jail, inscribing their names and other messages on various walls and doorways in the building. Those mentioned in the graffiti in the jail include Robert Emmet, Éamon de Valera, Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy, among many others. \r\n\r\nAs Kilmainham Jail lay derelict for so long, over the years much of the graffiti has faded or disintegrated, with some having disappeared completely. Written in Stone is a product of years of painstaking research into the graffiti and the (sometimes little-known) people who made them. The book, which contains photographs of many of the pieces of graffiti, discusses some of the heartbreaking messages left for posterity, as well as drawings of the Four Courts and even of Adolf Hitler.

The author provides parents with strategies to learn how to handle the relentless pressure from society and the media to provide a \'perfect\' childhood and instead to raise their children with a more relaxed and joyful approach, more in touch with the outdoors and the community around them.',1792,'2015-09-06 15:02:30','2015-09-06','1792.jpg','1781173206','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cotton-Wool-Kids-Parents-Paranoid/dp/1781173206/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441545840&sr=1-1',0,1,0,0,288,'978-1781173206','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Public Displays of Emotion','Róisín Ingle','','Irish Times Ltd.','','Non-fiction',19,'Public Displays of Emotion','Public Displays of Emotion',1793,'2015-09-06 17:20:33','2015-09-10','1793.jpg','','','','The Irish Times Ltd.','https://www.irishtimes.com/offers/irish-times-books',0,1,0,0,1,'978-0907011477','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('About Sisterland','Martina Devlin','','Ward River Press','http://poolbeg.com/','Fiction',11,'Ireland','Welcome to Sisterland.

Even less known well known is the history of the elaborate page decorations of the Records which were the work of the celebrated Irish stained-glass artist and illustrator Harry Clarke. Drawing from published and unpublished sources, this beautifully illustrated book tells the story of how the Irish Memorial Records were commissioned and published, and provides a fascinating insight into the work of Harry Clarke as a little-known war artist.

Irish involvement began when an ethnic Irish unit was called into action during John Brown s abortive attempt to start an anti-slavery uprising in 1859. When the war started the Irish Volunteers were the first unit in South Carolina to volunteer for service. The most famous Irish unit in the Federal army, the Irish Brigade, which included the famous Fighting 69th , was formed in 1861 at the instigation of Thomas Francis Meagher from Waterford, who rose to Brigadier General and commanded the Brigade. The heroics of this brigade at Antietam, and elsewhere, became an important part of Irish American history. Many Irish made the supreme sacrifice in Union blue and Confederate grey, including Patrick Cleburne from Cork. He proved himself a capable commander on the Confederate side and earned the nom de guerre Stonewall of the West , counties are named after him in Alabama and Arkansas while a lake and city bear his name in Texas.

Six feet tall, elegantly beautiful and passionately political, this British heiress turned Irish revolutionary was the muse the young poet had been seeking. He would spread his dreams under her feet, as together they set about creating a new Ireland, through his poetry and her politics. \r\n\r\nYeats forged a poetic career from his unrequited love for Gonne and her proud and passionate “pilgrim soul”. But as the narrator of the story says, “when looked at from the other side of the bedsheets, most tales take a turning… and this one’s no different.” Their personal and political passion was fired by a shared interest in mind-altering substances and experiences, including hashish and mescalin, occult magic rituals and nationalistic fervour. The true story of what happened between these larger-than-life characters is more complex, and altogether more intriguing, than Yeats’s poetic myth. \r\n\r\nTHE SECRET ROSE (1897) by WB Yeats \r\nWB Yeats was a magician as well as a writer, a member of the secret occult society, The Golden Dawn. The 17 talismanic stories in his mystical book, The Secret Rose, revolve around men who must spend themselves in service to that rose, an occult symbol representing the ideal, the absolute, the self beyond self. When Yeats originally published these stories, his publisher refused to include two final stories that are here restored, to create the volume that the author originally intended - alongside the story of the passionate relationship that fired his vision and shaped his fictions. \r\n\r\nTogether, the two books in this twin-volume - a t',1843,'2015-09-17 12:57:19','2015-08-03','1843.jpeg','1909888173','','http://www.ornaross.com','','',1,0,1,0,418,'9781909888173','B00ZPWC1LE','English',64,0.0000,'0',''),('Ten Thoughts About Love: Poetry Pamphlet Series No 1','Orna Ross','','Font Publications','','Poetry',23,'Inspirational poetry','Poetry: there are times in life when nothing else will do.

Teenage, disadvantaged back','This book addresses the major issue of social care and child welfare in the twenty-first century, and in particular the imperative to integrate residential child care, leaving care and aftercare in order to achieve a congruent system of care. Currently these areas are disconnected elements of a system of care, whereas in an integrated system they would be fully connected. The book is focused on the situation in Ireland but offers international relevance. An ecological perspective, with recognition of the importance of both the child and the worker as dyadic elements within this system, is the focus throughout. The child\'s perspective is presented through a biographical narrative of a former child in care and with case studies from the author\'s practice experience. The workers\' perspective is addressed through detailed critical analysis of the elements which constitute the profession of social care, which include practice, theory, approaches to care, policy, rights, research, legislation, social justice, professionalisation, privatisation and the socio-political and socio-economic factors which impact on the profession of social care, and therefore children in care.Through this analysis a nuanced and informed perspective, identifying both strengths and weaknesses, is offered on the care system in Ireland in 2015. The book identifies significant deficiencies in the current aftercare services available in Ireland, and advocates for a statutory entitlement to aftercare support for all care leavers.

In this collection of essays, a range of academics, economists and political commentators delineate the reactionary course that Ireland has followed since the ignominious demise of the Celtic Tiger. They argue that the forces of neoliberalism have employed the economic crisis they caused to advance policies that are in their own narrow interests, and that the host of regressive measures imposed since the onset of global recession has fundamentally restructured Irish society.

However, Diarmuid O Grada now shows us a Dublin quite unlike that depicted in the conventional histories of grand red-brick squares and elegant drawing rooms. Phenomenal population growth was forced on a place where local government, the workshops and the streets themselves had changed little since medieval times. In the course of the century the number of Dubliners trebled and the city was quite unprepared for the urgent challenge of feeding and housing so many people. In addition, Dublin\'s role as the bastion of an English colony was transformed into that of the Irish capital. This book explains how Dublin\'s adjustment to the new reality gave rise to widespread civil unrest and how the official reaction to the turmoil took on aspects of a crusade. Most of these responses failed and, in reality, there were periods when the city was running out of control. Diarmuid O Grada draws on a wide range of sources, including newspapers and parish records that had previously been neglected. His own career as a town planner has given him an understanding of urban impacts in terms of time and space. Georgian Dublin explains the processes at work and sets them within the wider context, comparing Dublin\'s successes and failures with events in other European cities.',1927,'2015-10-20 12:55:38','2015-10-01','1927.jpg','','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Georgian-Dublin-Forces-That-Shaped/dp/1782051473',1,0,0,0,296,'978-1782051473','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Nation\'s Favourite Healthy Food','Neven Maguire','','Gill & McMillan','http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/','Cuisine',9,'Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Galway','Every day I meet people who are looking to make healthier choices for their kitchen table.

The island\'s wild man, James Lynchehaun, was convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Best-selling historian Tim Pat Coogan offers a strongly personal perspective on the Irish century that followed the Rising - charting a flawed history that is marked as much by complacency, corruption and institutional and clerical abuse, as it is by the sacrifices and nation-building achievements of the Republic\'s founding fathers.',1966,'2015-10-31 23:08:57','2015-11-05','1966.jpg','','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/1784080098/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1446331860&sr=8-1&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=tim+pat+coogan&dpPl=1&dpID=51Wwc2ZVoGL&ref=plSrch',1,0,1,0,352,'978-1784080099','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('To Speak of Easter Week: Family Memories of the Irish Revolution','Helen O\'Keeffe ','','Mercier Press','http://www.mercierpress.ie/','History',2,'GPO, Easter Week, The Rising, James Connolly, Irish Books ','This book offers a broad and human perspective on the Easter Rising and its aftermath, using oral history recordings from the families of those involved and adding something new and unique to the wealth of material about 1916 already on the market. \'To Speak of Easter Week\' draws on interviews recorded by Maurice O\'Keeffe for the Irish Life and Lore Series.

One of Ireland\'s leading literary critics, Pine asks, What links Ireland and Greece? The author\'s trenchant, provocative arguments acknowledge both the strengths and the weaknesses of Greece today, and draw suggestive parallels with the Irish situation. In particular, Greece through Irish Eyes examines the shared history of Ireland and Greece * in wars of independence and civil wars * in the pandemic of clientelism * in the Church/State nexus * in the power of political dynasties * in economic crises. Pine pays special attention to the family values of honour, loyalty, and economy, arguing that these are at the heart of Greek society and culture. He develops this in a comprehensive survey of Greek law, literature and politics, and Greece\'s position at the centre of Balkan affairs. He graphically describes the effects of austerity on society and the economy, with up-to-the-minute accounts of the new government\'s attempts to renegotiate Greece\'s bailout.He strongly criticises the intransigence of bureaucracy, the pervasiveness of bribery and corruption and the continuing threats of terrorism and fascism. Richard Pine also calls for a major rethink on Greek and Irish positions on Europe. The parallels between Ireland and Greece may make some readers uncomfortable, but they are substantiated by solid examples of cultural, economic and historical differences which argue against integration into a centre-dominated Europe. \"Greece is a country I both love and mourn.

Desperate to get the upper hand, the South Staffs storm the barricades after dawn. Through the sights of a borrowed pair of binoculars Frank takes aim from the Jameson malthouse high above. The street is soon littered with casualties and the British troops are forced to withdraw. Pearse\'s surrender begins the next chapter of this extraordinary story. In the eventful years that follow, Frank, formerly a civil servant at the Land Commission, will spend jail terms in Stafford, Brixton and Wormwood Scrubs.When he gets home to Ballaghadereen, County Roscommon he is placed under close surveillance by MI5, the military and police in Ireland. He is court-martialled in Frongoch internment camp when as Hut Leader he protects other prisoners from conscription. Incarcerated at Usk Prison in Wales he leads a daring four-man escape to freedom. But he didn\'t like to talk about it. And when Ireland\'s War of Independence descends into Civil War he lays down his gun forever. Drawing on prison letters, personal diaries, secret military and police files, Grandpa the Sniper retraces a remarkable journey by a reluctant hero. Extensively researched and written by his grandson and namesake, it\'s a fascinating trawl through a very personal history. Part biography, part memoir, it offers readers a rare insight into one of the quiet men who gav',1987,'2015-11-04 12:49:36','2015-11-18','1987.jpg','','','','The Liffey Press','http://www.theliffeypress.com/grandpa-the-sniper-the-remarkable-story-of-a-1916-volunteer-by-frank-shouldice.html',0,1,0,0,400,'9781908308801','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Brooklyn - Movie-tie-in edition','Colm Tóibín','','Penguin','http://www.penguin.com','Fiction',11,'Wexford, Manhattan, New York, Enniscorthy, ','It is Ireland in the early 1950s and for Eilis Lacey, as for so many young Irish girls, opportunities are scarce.

But your first day on Stasis is guaranteed to be monumentally unexpected. A professional cellist named Abigail Perdue crosses the divide. After a harrowing subway accident she awakens in the afterlife where she is processed and prepared for final judgment. But it\'s not what she\'d ever imagined. Abigail\'s life will be judged, but that judgment is not handed down by a Creator. Instead five other new arrivals will examine her life and vote on her fate-and she will have a vote on theirs. These six of disparate religious, social and economic backgrounds must hear each other\'s stories and then decide on that soul\'s next step: eternal peace in Heofon; rebirth on Earth; or destruction in Gehenna. The Judging of Abigail Perdue is a provocative, touching story laced with moral dilemmas - how would you vote? Could you condemn a sullied soul? It also demands the reader ask: how have I lived my life, how will I be judged? A speculative fiction with deep empathy and spirituality, the story probes our myriad motivations: money, sex, greed, power, loss and the parts of us that exist in the gray. Abigail\'s tale mirrors the muddled human condition and the journey that we all must make, alone and afraid as we defend the choices and actions of a lifetime. Like Mitch Albom\'s The Five People You Meet in Heaven or W.P Young\'s, The Shack, this is a book that will be embraced by both those of traditional religious belief as well as non-traditional spirituality.

It offers twelve stepping stones to help anyone navigate through difficult times, especially when life doesn\'t go according to plan, or when it changes dramatically due to a life-changing event. The book is inspired by the author\'s autistic son, Cian. Cian is mostly non-verbal. Words do not come easy for him, but when he speaks his words have proved to be meaningful and often profound. The author shares her son\'s wisdom with the reader and demonstrates how his insight has taught her how to live a life of her own against the odds. Each of the twelve chapters contains a stepping stone inspired by Cian\'s simple words and messages: 1. \"All broken\"- examines brokenness and the road to acceptance so healing can begin. 2. \"Sad\" - gives the reader permission to grieve. 3. \"Shush!\"- explores the gift of silence in a fast paced world. 4. \"Sor-ree\" - gently encourages the reader to heal the hurting heart. 5. \"Never mind\"- empowers the reader to let go and mind less by living in the present. 6. \"All done now\" - prepares the reader for a new beginning. 7.\" Press the button!\" - brings the reader back to their passions and back to themselves. 8. \"Feck\'s sake, Jeo quist!\" - is a little reminder that Rome wasn\'t built in a day. 9. \"Giggles\" - instills fun and laughter along every step of the journey back. 10. \"Duh worree\" - demonstrates how the reader must ignore the crazy fears and do it anyway. 11. \"I lu vu\" - reflects on the power of love of loving ourselves and others. 12. \"Chocit Cake?\" - A stepping stone to celebrating life just as it is.',2008,'2015-11-06 16:56:11','2015-11-12','2008.jpg','190830877X','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Our-Own-Learning-Autism/dp/190830877X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1446828533&sr=1-1&keywords=a+life+of+our+own%2C+aileen+mcgee',0,1,0,0,1,'978-1908308771','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Fur','Grace Wells','','Dedalus Press ','http://www.dedaluspress.com/home','Poetry',23,'Irish books','Grace Wells\' second collection of poems is a sustained meditation on our relationship with nature, with the flora and especially the fauna with which we share this \"astonishing world\".

But if the relationship can be an enabling one, allowing the poet to go beyond the limits of herself, to put seal \"skin onto her back\" and walk out \"into darkness\", it is also one that our unthinking custodianship of the planet puts at risk. The poems of Fur do not see the animal realm as entirely other, as a place to view or visit. Indeed much of their strength derives from a refusal to acknowledge arbitrary boundaries.

But some years ago, as I was sitting with my Aunt Chris during her final days, she related to me some old stories about the Higgins family. I then realised I hardly knew anything about my own family, and thought it would be an interesting and worthwhile project to document its history for future generations. So what started out as a ‘few pages’ on the family history ended up with this book! The world can change so much in the span of one person’s lifetime that a younger audience can be enthralled, and often bemused, at how life used to be only a few decades back. So I believe we need to hear and record the stories that people like my Aunt Chris have to tell, before they are lost in the mists of time.\r\n\r\nBut those who have lived through periods of change may also like to reminisce about how those changes relate to their own lives and the people they’ve met, known and loved (and one or two others!).\r\n\r\nSo this book is, in my humble way, intended for both younger and older readers. It shows how every life brings fresh challenges and new opportunities that enrich us as human beings. Those challenges can test us, and the opportunities can lead us who knows where.

J.

In many ways it is also a biography of his wife, Roberta (nee Black), whose manuscript journal is also in the public domain. To establish Hewitt\'s late arrival as a poet, the book opens with a chapter recounting his negotiations with a London publisher over a long period and the eventual appearance of No Rebel Word (1949). Successive chapters trace his education, courtship, literary apprenticeship, first employment as a junior gallery curator in Belfast, the political conflicts of the 1930s and then the War Years, his rejection for the post of director in Belfast\'s Civic Museum and Gallery, and his utopian commitment to regionalism. Appointment to the Herbert Gallery in Coventry in 1956 brought recognition and confidence. His leanings towards socialist realism came to accommodate abstract art, and he defended the sculptor Barbara Hepworth against the penny-pinching ratepayers. Throughout this two-part career, Hewitt maintained his output as poet, culminating in the Collected Poems (1968). His Irish political commitments never wavered, though he became cautious about forms of nationalism which proclaimed themselves left-wing. Roberta Hewitt\'s work for the Coventry Labour Party provided an outlet for her energies and her domestic frustrations. Throughout these forty years, the poetry is kept constantly in view, sometime by reference to individual pieces and their origins, and some by means of longer \'breaks for text\' where more detailed criticism is practised. In 1972, the Hewitts returned to Belfast whenthe Troubles reached an ugly peak. Committed to anti-sectarianism, Hewitt withheld support from all parties, though he took an interest in trade union activity.

Born in the heart of East Belfast in the North, he is revered as a Celtic soul hero in the South. His music, while rooted in jazz and blues and soul, has an Irish accent—a distinctly Protestant Irish accent. Morrison’s songs form a map of this small island—a map of places, people, and cultures, too. They evoke a long-ago Belfast at a time before it became violently divided by sectarian conflict during the Troubles. They laud literary giants James Joyce, W.B. Yeats, and Oscar Wilde. They tell of the immigrant experience, the going away from the land that has long been Ireland’s heartache. And they form a map of Morrison himself, revealing more than this notoriously difficult character ever would in interviews or conversations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Sense Of Wonder&lt;/em&gt; is not a biography of Van Morrison. Rather, it is a journey through the Ireland depicted in his songs—a journey that begins in Hyndford Street, where we encounter the likes of John McCormack and The McPeake Family, and culminates in a unique picture of an idyllic, almost mythical Ireland where spirituality trumps organised religion, and art yields a stronger legacy than politics. Drawing on original research and interviews with a wide range of characters—from collaborators and associates of Morrison to Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson and actor Liam Neeson—this is a book about the Ireland that made Morrison, and the Ireland that he has remade himself through a stunning, sprawling body of work that spans almost six decades.',2058,'2015-11-19 19:58:58','2013-10-30','2058.jpg','1908279486','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sense-Wonder-Van-Morrisons-Ireland/dp/1908279486/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447962546&sr=1-5&keywords=A+Sense+of+Ireland',0,1,0,0,0,'978-1908279484','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('For Love of Anna','James Lawless','','James Lawless','http://jameslawless.net/','Fiction',11,'love story, ballet philopsohy, corruptiin in high places,university life, ideology,capitalism, anarc','When university student Guido van Thool accidentally bumps into the beautiful ballerina Anna Zweig in Loti’s café, it sets them off on a whirlwind romance of ballet concerts, anti-globalisation marches and love trysts in bluebell woods.

The biographies selected compose an inclusively broad picture of the rising, representing the spectrum of personalities and perspectives that were involved in the event. They include not only the insurgents (and some others) killed during the rising but also some of the women who were involved as soldiers or in supporting capacities; three nationalist leaders who opposed the rising; some of the senior figures in the British administration in Ireland in 1916; members of the British army that suppressed the rising; and two historians who made considerable contributions to the scholarly debate on 1916. This selection aims to give a balanced view of the rising.

The area of Dublin between the Canals was taken by an amalgamation of the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army (ICA), Cumann na mBan, and the Fianna. Padraic Pearse was appointed Commandant-General and James Connolly was appointed Commandant-General of the Dublin Division. By the end of the week, about 2100 men and women were in the garrisons. Though some women carried weapons, most of the Cumann na mBan women saw their roles confined to nursing, cooking and dispatch carrying. Not only were they the primary dispatch runners, they also passed through the British lines to get food supplies and ammunition, often hiding these in their clothes. These were all dangerous missions, and the women often held up vans, commandeering their contents at gun-point. Most of the women who wrote accounts of their activities eliminated any trace of heroism when relating their experiences. Few of the accounts give any indication of the excitement and colour of the week. They wrote that there was little drama attached to their duties, and so they just ‘got on with it’.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis book lists those who made up the garrisons, and gives a short biography of them.

For all workers, and all employers, his name is synonymous with militancy and solidarity.And yet this \'hero\' succeeded in instigating a civil war in Dublin trade unionism, and in time came to be vilified as a \'wrecker\' by some of his former comrades.In Big Jim Larkin Emmet O\'Connor reveals a man who proves to be both hero and wrecker',2136,'2015-12-10 10:31:26','2015-12-10','2136.jpg','','','','University College Dublin Press','http://www.ucdpress.ie/display.asp?K=9781906359935&aub=Emmet%20O%20Connor&m=4&dc=4',1,0,0,0,360,'9781906359935','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Hare\'s Vision','William Methven','','Temair Publishing Ireland','','Fiction',11,'Irish, celtic, christian, history, spirituality, mythology, legend,','It is a bewitching story of the odyssey in the sixth century of an Irish monk, Cormac, his muse Zachariah the hare and their strange band of companions who struggle from Egypt to Ireland to protect Jesus’ last testament, known as The Word, from those who would suppress its inspiring and radical message.',2133,'2015-12-07 13:33:41','2015-12-07','2133.jpg','0993395007','In 36AD radical Jewish teacher and zealot, Yeshua ben Pandira lies dying of his wounds in Judaea. Disturbed by a vision that his teachings will be misused by the Roman Empire, Yeshua lives long enough to dictate his final testament, later known as The Word, to Joseph of Arimithaea. However because of its radical teachings, The Word is suppressed by the early church and completely disappears in the third century.   So it was in the sixth century that the Patriarch of Alexandria chose Father Cormac mac Fliande for the task that would bring light to the Dark Ages.  Then in modern times The Word is re-discovered buried under the ruins of an ancient church in Ireland.

History remembers it as Irish rebel against English soldier, but the truth is more complicated. Thousands of British army soldiers in the Rising were Irishmen, including Second-Lieutenant Robert Barton from Glendalough, who later became a Sinn Féin TD and a signatory of the Anglo-Irish Truce, the infamous Captain John Bowen-Colthurst on whose orders Francis Sheehy-Skeffington was executed, and the eclectic scientist and inventor Prof. John Joly from Co. Offaly who, at fifty-eight, helped to defend Trinity College Dublin throughout the Rising. Many enlisted to fight for Irish Home Rule or Ulster Unionism, to find adventure or escape from poverty. None imagined they would find themselves on the streets of Dublin, killing and being killed by fellow Irishmen. Forty-one Irishmen in the British army died in action during the Rising, 106 were wounded.

In this period, the government began to invest in town planning, new opportunities arose for the country\'s architects, and the old buildings of the core began to be replaced by modern structures. The early manifestations of this process were well received, understood as the first visible signs of prosperity and broader social and economic modernization. However, this attitude was short lived. By the end of the 1960s, popular support for urban change had evaporated; a disparate movement of preservationists, housing activists, students, and architects emerged to oppose urban change and campaign for the retention of the city\'s heritage. The new buildings and urban forms had not brought the promised national rejuvenation. Instead, the rapid destruction of the extant city had come to be seen as symbolic of the corruption and failed promise of modernization. \r\n\r\nModern Dublin examines this story. Using approaches from urban studies and cultural geography, the author reveals Dublin as a place of complex exchange between a variety of interest groups with different visions for the built environment, and thus for society and the independent nation. In so doing, Erika Hanna adds to growing literatures on civil society, heritage, and cultural politics since independence, and provides a fresh approach to social and cultural change in 1960s Ireland.',2145,'2015-12-11 16:01:30','2013-08-01','2145.jpg','0199680450','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Dublin-1957-1973-Historical-Monographs/dp/0199680450/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1449849134&sr=1-1&keywords=Modern+Dublin',1,0,0,0,240,'978-0199680450','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Churchill and Ireland','Paul  Bew','','Oxford University Press','https://global.oup.com/academic/product/churchill-and-ireland-9780198755210?q=dublin&lang=en&cc=no','History',2,'Stormount, Anglo-Irish Treaty, Home Rule, Eamon de Valera, IRA, Blenheim Palace','Winston Churchill spent his early childhood in Ireland, had close Irish relatives, and was himself much involved in Irish political issues for a large part of his career. He took Ireland very seriously - and not only because of its significance in the Anglo-American relationship. Churchill, in fact, probably took Ireland more seriously than Ireland took Churchill. Yet, in the fifty years since Churchill\'s death, there has not been a single major book on his relationship to Ireland. It is the most neglected part of his legacy on both sides of the Irish Sea. \r\n\r\nDistinguished historian of Ireland Paul Bew now at long last puts this right.

S. O\'Hegarty, Sean O\'F','Remembering the Irish Revolution chronicles the ways in which the Irish revolution was remembered in the first two decades of Irish independence. While tales of heroism and martyrdom dominated popular accounts of the revolution, a handful of nationalists reflected on the period in more ambivalent terms. For them, the freedoms won in revolution came with great costs: the grievous loss of civilian lives, the brutalisation of Irish society, and the loss of hope for a united and prosperous independent nation. To many nationalists, their views on the revolution were traitorous. For others, they were the courageous expression of some uncomfortable truths. \r\n\r\nThis volume explores these struggles over revolutionary memory through the lives of four significant, but under-researched nationalist intellectuals: Eimar O\'Duffy, P. S. O\'Hegarty, George Russell, and Desmond Ryan. It provides a lively account of their controversial critiques of the Irish revolution, and an intimate portrait of the friends, enemies, institutions and influences that shaped them. \r\n\r\nBased on wide-ranging archival research, Remembering the Irish Revolution puts the history of Irish revolutionary memory in a transnational context. It shows the ways in which international debates about war, human progress, and the fragility of Western civilisation were crucial in shaping the understandings of the revolution in Ireland. It provides a fresh context for analysis the major writers of the period, such as Sean O\'Casey, W. B. Yeats, and Sean O\'Faolain, as well as a new outlook on the genesis of the revisionist/nationalist schism that continues to resonate in Irish society today.',2147,'2015-12-11 16:22:38','2015-12-13','2147.jpg','019873915X','','','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Remembering-Irish-Revolution-Nationalism-Historical/dp/019873915X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1449850419&sr=1-1&keywords=Remembering+the+Irish+Revolution',1,0,0,0,272,'978-0198739159','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Irish Poems of Alfred Perceval Graves: Songs of the Gael; A Gaelic Story-Telling','Alfred Percival Graves','','Leopold Classic Library','http://www.leopoldclassiclibrary.com/','Poetry',23,'Songs of old Ireland, Harlech, Charles Percival, Limerick, John Cheyne, Irish Books','Classic poetry by Alfred Perceval Graves including Songs of the Gael and A Gaelic Story-Telling',2148,'2015-12-11 16:41:23','2015-12-14','2148.jpg','','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Irish-Poems-Alfred-Perceval-Graves/dp/B018SQ14AC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1449851524&sr=1-1',0,0,1,0,138,'','B018SQ14AC','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Lure of Far-Away Places: Maritime Tales of Adventure Afloat and Ashore ','Norman Freeman','','The Liffey Press','http://www.theliffeypress.com/','Autobiography',5,'RTE, Snday Miscellany, Bombay, Dublin, ','This amusing and often moving book consists of 59 short tales about real-life events at sea: The amorous captain who showed chosen women passengers the stars after midnight; the zoo-bound warthog who escaped; the good and bad behaviour of ships\' crews at times of disaster; the alcoholic ship\'s doctor who feared having to perform an operation on the high seas; the albatross who followed the ship for three days; the eagle who landed on the wing of the bridge; the ship\'s dartboard that was bartered for sex ...Then there was the ship\'s cat who survived three wartime sinkings; the Irish barber on a cruise ship who shaved the legs of a voluptuous duchess; the Christmas pudding so saturated with spirits that it became a fire hazard.

After seven years working in Cajun Country he discarded the Roman Collar and joined President Johnson\'s War on Poverty. Working on the front lines of the civil rights movement in Baton Rouge he had more than a few memorable experiences. The soft-spoken Irishman would be branded as an \'agitator\' by the local U.S. Congressman and would later be booted out of the anti-poverty programme.

In 1995 he published Creating the Resilient Organization (Prentice Hall), a book sharing insights on engaging and motivating employees.After 9/11 Deevy became concerned about the increasing polarization of American society. The weak response by President George W. Bush to Hurricane Katrina and the drowning of New Orleans increased his concerns about the drift of American society.

It argues that the war, as a unique interregnum in the history of Northern Ireland, challenged the entrenched political and social makeup of the province and had a profound effect on its cultural life. Critical approaches to Northern Irish literature and culture have often been circumscribed by topographies of partition and sectarianism, but the Second World War generated conditions for reimagining the province within broader European and global contexts. These have perhaps been obscured by the amount of critical attention that has been paid to the impact of the Troubles on the culture of the province, and for this reason the book focuses on material produced before the flaring of political violence towards the end of the 1960s.

She met liberals and Islamists, Hamas and Fatah supporters, rich and poor. Used to western reporters dashing in and out of the Strip in times of crisis, the people she met were touched by her genuine, unflinching interest and spoke openly to her about life in their open-air prison. What she finds are a people who, far from the story we are so often fed, overwhelmingly long for peace and an end to the violence that has so grossly distorted their lives. The impression we take away from the book is of a people whose real, complex, nuanced voice has rarely been heard before. A MONTH BY THE SEA gives unique insight into the way in which isolation has shaped this society: how it radicalises young men and plays into the hands of dominating patriarchs, yet also how it hardens determination not to give in and turns family into a towering source of support. Underlying the book is Dervla\'s determination to try to understand how Arab Palestinians and Israeli Jews might forge a solution and ultimately live in peace. Dervla looks long and hard at the hypocrisies of Western and Israeli attitudes to peace\', and at Palestinian attitudes to terrorism. While this shattered people long for a respite from the bombings that have ripped a hole, both literally and psychologically, in their world, it seems that politicians have an agenda that pays little attention to their plight.',2177,'2015-12-22 09:08:58','2015-12-26','2177.jpg','1780600674','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Month-Sea-Encounters-Gaza/dp/1780600674/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1450775052&sr=1-4&keywords=dervla+murphy',0,1,0,0,272,'978-1780600673','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle','Dervla Murphy','','Eland Publishing Ltd ','http://www.travelbooks.co.uk/','Travel',31,'Lismore, Co.

Margaret MacCurtain Born into a well-to-do family living in Simmonscourt Castle, Dublin in 1934, Catherine McCann lived a rarefied life, playing tennis and attending parties as part of Dublin s upper social circle. Yet at the young age of 20 she left this lifestyle for one devoted to the service of others, joining the Religious Sisters of Charity. Her life as a religious opened her eyes and soul to the world, through her work in healthcare and her study of theology. In her late thirties Catherine met a priest named Charlie O Connor, and a deep bond developed. They worked together on many projects, including leading a large number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land. When Catherine received a call within a call to come out she left religious life, but continued to lead a life of service as a physiotherapist, counsellor and spiritual director. Her departure was not a rejection of her religion but simply a change in her expression of faith, which would continue to grow throughout her life. In 1979 she bought a cottage in County Wicklow and created Shekina Sculpture Garden, a place for reflective days and celebrations. In Gratitude is the story of an ordinary life, lived to the full. It is rich in social history, from growing up in one of Dublin s grandest houses, to religious life in Ireland and abroad, to developing a more holistic life of service. This book will appeal to all those interested in the pursuit of creativity and friendship, service and faith, set across a background of national, religious and social change.',2197,'2015-12-29 16:48:27','2016-01-03','2197.jpg','1909895768','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gratitude-Story-Gift-Filled-Life-Catherine-McCann/dp/1909895768/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451407162&sr=1-1&keywords=IN+GRATITUDE%2C+catherine+mccann',0,1,0,0,178,'978-1909895768','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Writing on the Wall: A Visual History of Northern Ireland\'s Troubles','Stuart Borthwick','','The Bluecoat Press','http://bluecoatpress.co.uk/','Art',1,'The Bogside, Free Derry Corner, The Troubles, Divis Flats, Irish Books, Ian Paisley, IRA, UDA, RUC','The murals of Northern Ireland are a unique cultural expression of a country beset by centuries of conflict.

Life in the Deep South proved to be startlingly different from that in Northern Ireland, and Rea struggled to find an outlet for his love of soccer. Before long, the Ulsterman stumbled upon Finn McCool’s pub and the wonderfully eccentric, international crowd that gathers there to watch European football games.\r\n\r\nFrank “the Tank,” the pot-growing Dutch national; Dave “the Rave” Ashton, a forty-six-year-old physiotherapist from Manchester dubbed “the world’s oldest teenager”; and Benji Haswell, a former political activist from South Africa, are three of the rare and vibrant characters who populated the pub’s stools. Soon Rea, along with this idiosyncratic mix of locals and ex-pat regulars, formed a pub soccer team, joined a league, and started dreaming of victory.\r\n\r\nOn August 27, 2005, with former pro footballer Scottish Steve “Macca” McAnespie as their coach, members of the team sat in the pub discussing their upcoming match. The next day, Hurricane Katrina enveloped the Gulf Coast, scattering Rea and his teammates around the world in seek of shelter and stability.\r\n\r\nThis luminous, gripping work follows the author and Finn regulars as they rebuild their lives and their team.

The two places where his architectural influence is still strongly felt today are the high-fashion enclave of Henrietta Street, Dublin, of which he created about one-third in the period 1733 c.1740, and the Phoenix Park, of which he was Ranger, where he made important improvements to the landscape and where he built in 1752–7 a new Ranger’s Lodge which forms the nucleus of today’s Áras an Uachtaráin. The book provides a detailed analysis of these aesthetic achievements and (following Clements’ death) of the re casting of the Ranger’s Lodge as a British viceregal residence during the period 1782–c.1800. It concludes with a broader discussion of the ‘amateur’ tradition in British and Irish architecture and of Clements’ place among the ‘amateurs’ who dominated the art form in the decades before the coming-of-age of a fully-fledged architectural profession.',2315,'2016-01-26 09:20:42','2016-01-26','2315.jpg','','','','Four Courts Press','http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/books/2015/nathaniel-clements/',1,0,0,0,290,'978-1-85182-914-9','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('How Celtic Culture Invented Southern Literature','James P.

Mr. Cantrell presents persuasive historical and literary evidence that it was the South’s Celtic—Irish, Scots, Welsh, or Scots-Irish—settlers who had the greatest influence on Southern culture, and their vibrant spirit is still felt today. \r\nMr. Cantrell targets William Gilmore Simms as the most important antebellum Southern writer and devotes an entire chapter to his work. Among writers published after the Civil War, he focuses on Ellen Glasgow, Caroline Gordon, and the Agrarians. William Faulkner’s writing receives special attention, especially the Gaelic influences on Thomas Sutpen in Absalom, Absalom!

Playful language accompanied by Celtic-inspired illustrations makes this hopeful tale of three brave mice a great lesson of teamwork and the ability of good to triumph evil.\r\n',2334,'2016-01-26 20:04:17','2009-01-21','2334.jpg','1589806638','For more details, please visit pelicanpub.com','http://www.pelicanpub.com/proddetail.php?prod=9781589806634','Amazon.com','http://www.amazon.com/St-Patrick-Three-Brave-Mice/dp/1589806638/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453838217&sr=1-1&keywords=patrick+and+the+three+brave+mice',1,0,0,0,32,'9781589806634','9781589806634','English',91,0.0000,'0',''),('Classic Golf Links of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland','Donald Steel, Brian  Morgan, Peter  Thompson','','Pelican Publishing Company','http://www.pelicanpub.com','Sports',27,'golf, sports, classic, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Irish, Steel, Morgan, Thompson, courses','Seaside links courses offer golfers unmatched challenges and enchanting scenery.

These links prove true the old belief that courses are for expanding a player’s abilities, rather than defining and confining them as in so many other sports. Steel offers up destinations like St. Andrews, Royal St. George’s, and Formby, Ballybunion, and Muirfield among the seaside playing fields that have been the home to championship tournaments and amateur aspirations.\r\n\r\nWith scorecards, maps, color photos, and helpful hints for most holes, this guide is an essential reference tool for the traveling golfer. It tells the history of the courses it covers and provides information on the designers who built them and the pros who have set their records.\r\n\r\nBrian Morgan’s stunning photography handsomely captures the majestic layout of the courses. From the deceptive lengths to the treacherous traps, his visual log of the courses prepares golfers for the beauty and challenges that await them.

The purpose of this study is to understand the density of demand within Ireland and the extent to which Galway might be used as a point of distribution within Europe & the Middle East. From an economic perspective, however, Galway does not represent a population within rigid geographical boundaries, rather, it represents an area of dominant influence over markets in adjacent areas. This influence varies from one industry to another, but also from one period of time to another. \r\n\r\nIn what follows, I summarize the economic potential for Galway over the next five years for hundreds of industries, categories and products. The goal of this report is to report the real economic potential, or what an economist calls the latent demand, represented by Galway when defined as an area of dominant influence. The reader needs to realize that latent demand may or may not represent real sales. For many items, latent demand is clearly observable in sales, as in the case for food or housing items. Consider, however, the category \"satellite launch vehicles\". Clearly, there are no launch pads in Galway used by the space industry to launch satellites. However, the core benefit of the vehicles (e.g. telecommunications, etc.) is \"consumed\" by the area served by Galway. Without Galway, in other words, the market for satellite launch vehicles would be lower for the population in Ireland, Europe & the Middle East, or the world in general.

Author Frank Cullen considers selected features and areas of the mid-nineteenth-century city through the map extracts, using other sources to discuss the elements of urban life that lie behind maps. For example, the formal layout of Merrion Square with its fine buildings and notable residents is contrasted to the densely inhabited warren of lanes behind Mount Street, just minutes away. The impact of public buildings such as the Royal (later Collins\'s) Barracks is impressively evident in the plan, while the associated professional and trading activities of the surrounding area are less obvious in the unlabelled rows of buildings along Montpellier Hill and Barrack (later Benburb) Street. The maps extracts and commentaries are accompanied by contemporary illustrations; and are preceded by an introductory essay on Dublin in 1847. This is an ancillary publication to the Dublin series from the Irish Historic Towns Atlas. \'Dublin, part III, 1756 to 1847\' by Rob Goodbody is also available from the Royal Irish Academy.

It\'s a challenging and dangerous endeavour in a very male world - that is until Morgan, the second-in-command of the Impetus, realises there is a pregnant stowaway on board and that he is the father. It is too late to turn back, the ice is closing in, and the child will have to be born into the vast and icy wilderness of the Arctic.

The power of ambition, what drives human beings to take outrageous physical risks, the nature of courage, and of love - in an unforgettable setting, often bleak, sometimes beautiful, always conveyed in brilliant, keenly pared prose.

Leitrim, Irish prose, Amongst Women, Garda, Irish Books, Monaghan, ','John McGahern (1934-2006) has been widely acknowledged as one of the foremost Irish prose writers of the twentieth and the early twenty-first century. McGahern has traditionally been regarded as a \'chronicler\' of the lives of farmers, teachers and policemen in the Irish midlands in the twentieth century. The social and historical veracity which so many readers admire in his novels and stories accounts for his popular success in his native country. It has also been the subject of a significant body of criticism of his work. This new book on McGahern\'s fiction argues how he was not only an acute social commentator but also an intelligent and perceptive reader interested in the nature and function of literature. It presents McGahern as a highly literary writer aware of the various literary traditions he had inherited, and shows how his imagination was shaped by his lifelong immersion in Irish, English and European literature.Drawing on archival material as well as on original close readings of his fiction, Stanley van der Ziel examines how McGahern\'s reading of classic books and authors determined the concerns of his novels and stories, by placing some key elements of McGahern\'s aesthetic in their appropriate literary contexts. John McGahern and the Imagination of Tradition presents McGahern as a novelist of ideas by showing how his fiction engages in a knowing and self-conscious way with ideas about literature from different historical periods. It is a study of McGahern\'s fiction seen through the literary influences that shaped his imagination, which argues that McGahern\'s imagination absorbed things that interested him in the writers he had read and thought about, often for many decades, in order to make an art that was at once wholly individual and deeply traditional. In thematically arranged chapters on McGahern\'s debt to authors such as Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Wordsworth, the nineteenth-century Realists, Proust, Joyce, Yeats, Beckett and others, it demonstrates ',2361,'2016-02-04 12:35:15','2016-02-06','2361.jpg','1782051643','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/John-McGahern-Imagination-Tradition-Stanley/dp/1782051643/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454588992&sr=1-1&keywords=stanley+van+der+ziel',1,0,0,0,246,'978-1782051640','','Englsih',1,0.0000,'0',''),('A Different Journey','Brian D\'arcy, Terry  Wogan','','Sliabh Ban Productions Ltd','http://www.wheelers.co.nz/browse/publisher/35661-sliabh-ban-productions-ltd/','Lifestyle',38,'Fermanagh, London, spiritualism, Prayer, Irish Books','A book of reflection and contemplation upon life both religious and otherwise.\r\n',2362,'2016-02-04 12:46:54','2006-10-23','2362.jpg','0954582950','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Different-Journey-Brian-DArcy/dp/0954582950/ref=sr_1_12?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454589462&sr=1-12&keywords=wogan',0,1,0,0,0,'978-0954582951','','Englsih',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Boy They Tried to Hide: The true story of a son, forgotten by society','Shane Dunphy','','Hachette Books Ireland','http://www.hachette.ie/','Non-fiction',19,'Irish books.

Although much effort was expended by institutional Catholicism in trying to curb the violent propensities of the Fenians in the 19th century and the IRA in the 20th, its efforts were largely unsuccessful. Ironically, Catholicism had greater achievements to boast of in its influence in the British Empire as a whole than over its wayward flock in Ireland. But there was a cost in the church\'s commitment to British imperial expansion that did not always sit easily with growing nationalist expectations in Ireland. Although it provided support for the British forces in the First World War, by the time of the Second World War the church\'s views of that conflict differed little from those of the government of independent Ireland, although there were sufficient differences that ensured Catholicism was not just nationalism at prayer. These and other issues such as religious perceptions of the Famine, Cardinal Cullen\'s role in shaping the ethos of Irish Catholicism and the role of memory, including religious memory, in Irish violence combine to make this a fascinating study.',2365,'2016-02-05 08:57:44','2016-02-05','2365.jpg','','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Violence-Politics-Catholicism-Ireland-Rafferty/dp/1846825830/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454662044&sr=1-2',1,0,0,0,288,'978-1846825835','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('2016 - The Selected Satires of Kevin Higgins ','Kevin Higgins','','CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform ','https://www.createspace.com/','Poetry',23,'Irish books.
