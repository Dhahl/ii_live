After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London\'s most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. Today he is remembered for his epigrams, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death.\r\n\r\nWilde\'s parents were successful Anglo-Irish Dublin intellectuals. Their son became fluent in French and German early in life. At university, Wilde read Greats; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at Dublin, then at Oxford. He became known for his involvement in the rising philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new \"English Renaissance in Art\", and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversation, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote Salome (1891) in French in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to the absolute prohibition of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London.\r\n\r\nAt the height of his fame and success, while his masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), was still on stage in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde\'s lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The charge carried a penalty of up to two years in prison. The trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with other men. After two more trials he was convicted and imprisoned for two years\' hard labour. In 1897, in prison, he wrote De Profundis, which was published in 1905, a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.

During the 1930s and 1940s he wrote his first novels and short stories. He wrote a trilogy of novels in the 1950s as well as famous plays like Waiting for Godot. In 1969 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His later works included poetry and short story collections and novellas. He died on December 22, 1989 in Paris, France.\r\nSamuel Barclay Beckett was born on Good Friday, April 13, 1906, in Dublin, Ireland. His father, William Frank Beckett, worked in the construction business and his mother, Maria Jones Roe, was a nurse. Young Samuel attended Earlsfort House School in Dublin, then at 14, he went to Portora Royal School, the same school attended by Oscar Wilde. He received his Bachelor’s degree from Trinity College in 1927. Referring to his childhood, Samuel Beckett, once remaking, “I had little talent for happiness.” In his youth he would periodically experience severe depression keeping him in bed until mid-day. This experience would later influence his writing.\r\nIn 1928, Samuel Beckett found a welcome home in Paris where he met and became a devoted student of James Joyce. In 1931, he embarked on a restless sojourn through Britain, France and Germany. He wrote poems and stories and did odd jobs to support himself. On his journey, he came across many individuals who would inspire some of his most interesting characters.\r\nIn 1937, Samuel Beckett settled in Paris. Shortly thereafter, he was stabbed by a pimp after refusing his solicitations. While recovering in the hospital, he met Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnuil, a piano student in Paris. The two would become life-long companions and eventually marry. After meeting with his attacker, Beckett dropped the charges, partly to avoid the publicity.\r\nDuring World War II, Samuel Beckett’s Irish citizenship allowed him to remain in Paris as a citizen of a neutral country. He fought in the resistance movement until 1942 when members of his group were arrested by the Gestapo. He and Suzanne fled to the unoccupied zone until the end of the war.\r\nAfter the war, Samuel Beckett was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery during his time in the French resistance. He settled in Paris and began his most prolific period as a writer. In five years, he wrote Eleutheria, Waiting for Godot, Endgame, the novels Malloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable, andMercier et Camier, two books of short stories, and a book of criticism.\r\nSamuel Beckett’s first publication, Molloy, enjoyed modest sales, but more importantly praise from French critics. Soon, Waiting for Godot, achieved quick success at the small Theatre de Babylone putting Beckett in the international spotlight. The play ran for 400 performances and enjoyed critical praise.\r\nSamuel Beckett wrote in both French and English, but his most well-known works, written between WWII and the 1960s, were written in French. Early on he realized his writing had to be subjective and come from his own thoughts and experiences. His works are filled with allusions to other writers such asDante, Rene Descartes, and James Joyce. Beckett’s plays are not written along traditional lines with conventional plot and time and place references. Instead, he focuses on essential elements of the human condition in dark humorous ways. This style of writing has been called “Theater of the Absurd” by Martin Esslin, referring to poet Albert Camus’ concept of “the absurd.” The plays focus on human despair and the will to survive in a hopeless world that offers no help in understanding.\r\nThe 1960s were a period of change for Samuel Beckett. He found great success with this plays across the world. Invitations came to attend rehearsals and performances which led to a career as a theater director. In 1961, he secretly married Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnuil who took care of his business affairs. A commission from the BBC in 1956 led to offers to write for radio and cinema through the 1960s.\r\nSamuel Beckett continued to write throughout the 1970s and 80s mostly in a small house outside Paris.

He was also an Irish republican and a volunteer in the Irish Republican Army. Born in Dublin into a republican family, he became a member of the IRA\'s youth organisation Fianna Éireann at the age of fourteen. However, there was also a strong emphasis on Irish history and culture in the home, which meant he was steeped in literature and patriotic ballads from an early age. Behan eventually joined the IRA at sixteen, which led to his serving time in a borstal youth prison in the United Kingdom and he was also imprisoned in Republic of Ireland. During this time, he took it upon himself to study and he became a fluent speaker of the Irish language. Subsequently released from prison as part of a general amnesty given by the Fianna Fáil government in 1946, Behan moved between homes in Dublin, Kerry and Connemara, and also resided in Paris for a time. In 1954, Behan\'s first play The Quare Fellow, was produced in Dublin. It was well received; however, it was the 1956 production at Joan Littlewood\'s Theatre Workshop in Stratford, London, that gained Behan a wider reputation. This was helped by a famous drunken interview on BBC television. In 1958, Behan\'s play in the Irish language An Giall had its debut at Dublin\'s Damer Theatre. Later, The Hostage, Behan\'s English-language adaptation of An Giall, met with great success internationally. Behan\'s autobiographical novel, Borstal Boy, was published the same year and became a worldwide best-seller. He married Beatrice Ffrench-Salkeld in 1955. Behan was known for his drinking problem, which resulted in his suffering from diabetes, which ultimately resulted in his death on 20 March 1964. He was given an IRA guard of honour, which escorted his coffin. It was described by several newspapers as the biggest funeral since those of Michael Collins and Charles Stewart Parnell.

His most famous work is Ulysses (1922) which follows the movements of Leopold Bloom through a single day on June 16th, 1904. Ulysses is based on Homer’s The Odyssey.\r\n\r\nSome of Joyce’s other major works include the short story collection Dubliners (1914), and novels A Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). Joyce was born in Dublin on 2nd February 1882 and attended school in Clongowes Wood College and Belvedere College (just up the road from the Centre) before going on to University College, then located on St Stephen’s Green, where he studied modern languages.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from university, Joyce went to Paris, ostensibly to study medicine, and was recalled to Dublin in April 1903 because of the illness and subsequent death of his mother. He stayed in Ireland until 1904, and in June that year he met Nora Barnacle, the Galway woman who was to become his partner and later his wife.\r\n\r\nIn August 1904 the first of Joyce’s short stories was published in the Irish Homestead magazine, followed by two others, but in October Joyce and Nora left Ireland going first to Pola (now Pula, Croatia) where Joyce got a job teaching English at a Berlitz school. After he left Ireland in 1904, Joyce only made four return visits, the last of those in 1912, after which he never returned to Ireland.\r\n\r\n1914 proved a crucial year for Joyce. With Ezra Pound’s assistance, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce’s first novel, began to appear in serial form in Harriet Weaver’s Egoist magazine in London. His collection of short stories, Dubliners, on which he had been working since 1904, was finally published, and he also wrote his only play, Exiles. It was after these successes that Joyce began to think seriously about writing the novel he had been formulating since 1907: Ulysses.\r\n\r\nWith the start of World War One, Joyce and Nora, along with their two children, Giorgio and Lucia, were forced to leave Trieste and arrived in Zurich where they lived for the duration of the war. It was during this time that Joyce worked on Ulysses and included many characteristics of those around him in the characters of the book. Though Joyce wanted to settle in Trieste again after the War, the poet Ezra Pound persuaded him to come to Paris for a while, and Joyce stayed there for the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nIt was in Paris that Joyce met Sylvia Beach, an American ex-pat who helped him to publish Ulysses for the first time in 1922. From 1930, after Beach had relinquished the rights to Ulysses, Joyce became very close with Paul Léon, another ex-pat living in Paris. Léon became Joyce’s business advisor and close friend and helped him to publish his final book Finnegans Wake in 1939.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, when Joyce fled to the south of France ahead of the Nazi invasion, Léon returned to the Joyces’ apartment in Paris to salvage their belongings and put them into safekeeping for the duration of the war. It’s thanks to Léon’s efforts that many of Joyce’s personal possessions and manuscripts still survive today. James Joyce died at the age of fifty-nine, on 13 January 1941 in Schwesterhaus vom Roten Kreuz in Zurich where he and his family had been given asylum. He is buried in Fluntern cemetery, Zurich.

Higgins was born on 18 April 1941 in Limerick city and was raised in County Clare. He was a factory worker and a clerk before becoming the first in his family to access higher education. He studied at the University College Galway, the University of Manchester and Indiana University.\r\n\r\nMichael D. Higgins is married to Sabina Higgins, and they have four children. Sabina Higgins attended the Stanislavsky Studio of acting in Dublin and was a founding member of the Focus Theatre.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer in political science and sociology in National University of Ireland, Galway, and in the United States, Michael D. Higgins was a passionate proponent for the extension of access to third level education beyond the walls of established Universities. He was centrally involved in the development of extra-mural studies at National University of Ireland, Galway, and he travelled extensively across the West of Ireland to provide accessible evening classes for interested citizens.\r\n\r\nA desire to work more directly for equality and justice led Michael D. Higgins to enter public life and he went on to serve as a public representative at many levels from Councillor and Mayor to 9 years in the Seanad and 25 in Dáil Éireann.\r\n\r\nAs Ireland’s first Minister for the Arts in 1993-97, Michael D. Higgins’ achievements included the reinvigoration of the Irish film industry, the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge, now TG4, and the repeal of censorship under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Acts. He also established a rich network of local arts and cultural venues which brought a crucial access to citizens across Ireland to these facilities. Moreover, he drove the revitalisation of Ireland’s canal network, resulting in over 1,000 kilometres of navigable waterways, supporting thousands of jobs, and creating wealth in many rural and economically-deprived areas of the State.\r\n\r\nMichael D. Higgins has, like many in Ireland, seen generations of his family emigrate. He has a strong interest and solidarity with the Irish abroad and has been a regular visitor to Irish Centres in Britain.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Michael D. Higgins has campaigned for human rights and for the promotion of peace and democracy in Ireland and in many other parts of the world, from Nicaragua and Chile to Cambodia, Iraq and Somalia. In 1992, Michael D. Higgins was the first recipient of the Seán MacBride Peace Prize from the International Peace Bureau in Helsinki, in recognition of his work for peace and justice in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nMichael D. Higgins is also a writer and poet, contributing to many books covering diverse aspects of Irish politics, sociology, history and and culture. He has published two collections of essays — ‘Causes for Concern — Irish Politics, Culture and Society’ and ‘Renewing the Republic’. He has also published four collections of poetry — ’The Betrayal; The Season of Fire; An Arid Season’ and ‘New and Selected Poems’.

Several of his books have been made into films, beginning with The Commitments in 1991. Doyle\'s work is set primarily in Ireland, especially working-class Dublin, and is notable for its heavy use of dialogue written in slang and Irish English dialect. Doyle was awarded the Booker Prize in 1993 for his novel Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha. Doyle was born in Dublin and grew up in Kilbarrack, in a middle-class family. His mother, Ita Bolger Doyle, was a first cousin of the short story writer Maeve Brennan. Doyle graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from University College Dublin. He spent several years as an English and geography teacher before becoming a full-time writer in 1993. His personal notes and work books reside at the National Library of Ireland.  In addition to teaching, Doyle, along with Seán Love, established a creative writing centre, \"Fighting Words\", which opened in Dublin in January 2009. It was inspired by a visit to his friend Dave Eggers\' 826 Valencia project in San Francisco. He has also engaged in local causes, including signing a petition supporting journalist Suzanne Breen, who faced gaol for refusing to divulge her sources in court, and joining a protest against an attempt by Dublin City Council to construct 9 ft-high barriers which would interfere with one of his favourite views.

He is best known as the creator of the cult character, Ross O\'Carroll-Kelly a fictional rugby jock whose exploits have been the subject of fourteen novels that have sold one million copies in Ireland. He was named National Newspapers of Ireland Columnist of the Year in 2013 for his weekly column in The Irish Times on Saturday written under the Ross O\'Carroll-Kelly pseudonym. The column began in the sports pages of The Sunday Tribune in January 1998. The inspiration for the columns first came from a nonfiction article Howard was researching on Leinster schools rugby. The information he had gathered on the social activities engaged in by the young rugby players was unprintable for legal reasons; instead, Howard decided to use the material to inspire a set of characters (including Ross) attending the fictional school of \"Castlerock\".','','','','author909.jpg',1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Howard_%28journalist%29'),(911,'Patrick','Kavanagh','1904-10-21','Patrick Kavanagh (1904-67) is one of Ireland\'s best-loved poets: when the Irish Times compiled a list of favourite Irish poems in 2000, ten of Kavanagh\'s were in the top fifty, with only Yeats\'s name appearing more frequently. Kavanagh rose to such literary pre-eminence from the humblest of backgrounds. Born in Inniskeen parish, Co. Monaghan, his father was a cobbler and a farmer of sixteen acres. Kavanagh left school at twelve to apprentice as a cobbler himself, but having no aptitude for shoe-making, he helped instead on the family farm. So for the first 27 years of his life, Kavanagh lived the life of rural Ireland, the life of \"fairs and football matches, of mass-going and dance-going.\" (Seamus Heaney, The Sense of Place, a lecture given in the Ulster Museum, 1977). At the same time, despite this entirely unbookish background, Kavanagh was drawn to writing poems, his first appearing in the local papers in 1928. As he said of his early poetic development, \"I dabbled in verse and it became my life.\" His poems began to appear further afield and this prompted Kavanagh to leave home in 1931 and walk to Dublin, where his brother was already a teacher, to try and further his literary aspirations. To an extent he was successful, his first collection, Ploughman and Other Poems, appearing in 1936. From the first his poetry was marked by a fidelity to local detail and the real experience of Irish rural life (as opposed to the sentimentalised version which he despised), coupled with a vigorous colloquial language. However, it was precisely these qualities that led the educated Anglo-Irish elite, who dominated Dublin literary life at the time, to patronise him, referring to him as \"that Monaghan boy\". Kavanagh eked out a living as a journalist but his tendency to tell the unvarnished truth, together with a self-belief in his poetic gifts, made him enemies. Recalling this period in the 1963 recording from which his Archive poems are taken, Kavanagh wryly says \"every potential employer said I was a genius and therefore unemployable.\" Nevertheless, he continue to publish including, in 1942, his long poem \'The Great Hunger\' which chronicles the privations - mental, spiritual and physical - of the rural life he knew so intimately. This was followed by a loosely autobiographical novel, Tarry Flynn (1948), which was briefly banned. The poems of this middle period are judged less successful, partly because the quarrel he had with the literary establishment gave them a polemical quality. This was essentially a quarrel with himself, divided as he was between love on the one hand and contempt on the other for his roots in the \"the little hills...and stony grey soil\" (Bertrand Russell – see above) of his home. However, in 1954 personal crisis was to set his poetry on a new course. Firstly, Kavanagh pursued and lost a notorious libel action against a Dublin newspaper and secondly he was diagnosed with cancer and had a lung removed. It was during his convalescence while sitting beside the Grand Canal in Dublin that he underwent what he described as a \"re-birth\". There followed his happiest years during which he produced some of his greatest poems, full of new found optimism and love of the world. He now, at long last, began to receive the acclaim he felt he deserved, giving lectures at University College Dublin and in the USA. In April 1967 he married Katharine Maloney. He died later the same year, a week after being taken ill at the opening performance of the adaptation of Tarry Flynn at the Abbey Theatre. - See more at: http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/patrick-kavanagh#sthash.RnkoUz62.dpuf','','Innishkeen, Co.

Seán Ó Súilleabháin, the former archivist for the Irish Folklore Commission, described her as \"one of the greatest woman storytellers of recent times\"\r\n\r\nShe was born Máiréad Sayers in the townland of Vicarstown, Dunquinn, County Kerry, the youngest child of the family.[2] She was called Peig after her mother, Margaret \"Peig\" Brosnan, from Castleisland. Her father Tomás Sayers was a renowned storyteller who passed on many of his tales to Peig. At age 12, she was taken out of school and went to work as a servant for the Curran family in the nearby town of Dingle, where she said she was well treated. She spent two years there before returning home due to illness.[3]\r\n\r\nShe spent the next few years as a domestic servant working for members of the growing middle class produced by the Land War. She had expected to join her best friend, Cáit Boland, in America, but Cáit wrote that she had had an accident and could not forward the cost of the fare. Peig moved to the Great Blasket Island after marrying Pádraig Ó Guithín,[2] a fisherman and native of the island. She and Pádraig had eleven children, of whom six survived.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian scholar Carl Marstrander, who visited the island in 1907, urged Robin Flower, of the British Museum, to visit the Blaskets. Flower was keenly appreciative of Peig Sayers\' stories and tales. He recorded them and brought them to the attention of the academic world.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s a Dublin teacher, Máire Ní Chinnéide, who was a regular visitor to the Blaskets, urged Peig to tell her life story to her son Micheál. Peig was illiterate in the Irish language, although she received her early schooling through the medium of English. She dictated her biography to Micheál. He then sent the manuscript pages to Máire Ní Chinnéide in Dublin, who edited them for publication. It was published in 1936.\r\n\r\nOver several years from 1938 she dictated 350 ancient legends, ghost stories, folk stories, and religious stories to Seosamh Ó Dálaigh of the Irish Folklore Commission.[1]\r\n\r\nShe continued to live on the island until 1942, when she left the Island and returned to her native place, Dunquin.[5] She was moved to a hospital in Dingle, County Kerry where she died in 1958. She is buried in the Dún Chaoin Burial Ground, Corca Dhuibhne, Ireland. Her surviving children, except for her son Micheál, emigrated to the USA and live with their descendants in Springfield, Massachusetts.[citation needed]\r\nBooks\r\n\r\nSayers is most famous for her autobiography, Peig, ISBN 0-8156-0258-8, but also recounted folklore and other stories which were recorded in Machnamh Seanmhná/An Old Woman\'s Reflections, ISBN 978-0-19-281239-1. The books were not written by Peig but were reminiscences which she dictated to others.\r\nPeig\r\n\r\nPeig is among the most famous expressions of a late Gaelic Revival genre of personal histories by and about inhabitants of the Blasket Islands and other remote Irish locations. Tomás Ó Criomhthain\'s memoir an tOileánach (\"the Islandman\", 1929) and Robert J. Flaherty\'s documentary Man of Aran address similar subjects. The movement swiftly found itself the object of some derision and mockery – especially among the more cosmopolitan city dwellers of Ireland - for its often relentless depictions of rural hardship. Parody of the type reached its zenith with Flann O\'Brien\'s satire of an tOileánach as an Béal Bocht (\"the Poor Mouth\").\r\n\r\nPeig depicts the declining years of a traditional, Irish-speaking way of life characterised by poverty, devout Catholicism, and folk memory of gang violence, the Great Famine, and the Penal Laws. The often bleak tone of the book is established from its opening words:\r\n“ 	I am an old woman now, with one foot in the grave and the other on its edge.

They tore through the skies in flimsy biplanes. They soared across the seas in battleships. They charged across the tortured earth with bayonets fixed. They wrapped bandages and dabbed softly in the field hospitals. They prayed, they sang, they killed, they wept and they died. Popular historian Turtle Bunbury is renowned for uncovering important forgotten stories from our past. Here he reveals many never-before-heard tales of the Irish heroes and heroines whose lives coincided with one of the most brutal conflicts our world has ever known - including nuns, artists, sportsmen, poets, aristocrats, nationalists, nurses, clergymen and film directors. By turns poignant, enlightening, whimsical and darkly comic, this is history as it should be - free-wheeling and finely tuned to the rhythms of the human heart. <iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ymunXEKHgPI?list=UUjplKQ0w7-mgiGelQeiqn-A\" width=\"370\" height=\"208\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> REVIEWS \'Magnificent book...a superb production...something to be proud of...\'\r\nGay Byrne on Sunday with Gay Byrne, Lyric FM. \'An absolutely beautiful book...A lavish production with lots of pictures, lots of maps - it really captures the whole era.\' Patrick Geoghegan on Talking History, Newstalk FM \'A piece of Irish history that was sort of wilfully forgotten for a long time. The Glorious Madness is wall to wall with tales of some very interesting characters, including a number who played an important role in Irish history.\' Anton Savage - Savage Sunday, Today FM \'The impressively versatile Turtle Bunbury is known for his sensitively written, well-observed Vanishing Ireland series of books and his appearance on RTE\'s Genealogy Roadshow. He also toured this year as one of the lecturers in the Great War Roadshow, headed by Myles Dungan. Now, also marking the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, Bunbury marches into what once would have been a no-man\'s land for historians ...There is much to enjoy here. Bunbury has an eye for irony and pathos and a fluid attractive writing style.\r\nIt\'s packed worth personalities and stories of courage under fire amid truly unimaginable slaughter, of mind-boggling military incompetence and of individuals emotionally afflicted by reports of courage in another cause at home. The cast of characters is formidable.\' Emmanuel Kehoe, Sunday Business Post [In The Glorious Madness] Turtle continues the wonderful listening and yarn-spinning he has honed in the Vanishing Ireland series, applying it to veterans of the First World War. The stories he recreates are poignant, whimsical and bleakly funny, bringing back into the light the lives of people who found themselves on the wrong side of history after the struggle for Irish independence. This is my kind of micro-history. John Grenham, The Irish Times A wonderful book packed with great individual stories and pictures which bring the Irish participation in the Great War vividly alive.

He tells about the marriage of his mother and father in 1905, which was arranged in those days. He also speaks about the war of Independence when his father and his brother Johnny answered the call to fight for Ireland. His father was a nationalist fighter, a republican. There are many references to the Black and Tans during this war and how they raided the writer\'s house looking for guns. The writer grew up around the Dalkey area. They were times of poverty and he recalls how they lived in a corporation house and how he spent his time as a young boy playing games with the local children. His father worked as a gardener in Dun Laoghaire and he started that work in the year 1898.',10,'2014-05-29 22:49:46','1978-11-10','10.jpg','0413771687','Read more','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Leonard','Waterstones','http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/',0,1,0,0,208,'978-0413771681','','English',0,0.0000,'0',''),('Valley of the Squinting Windows','Brinsley McNamara','230','Anvil Books ','http://www.anvilpublishing.com/','Fiction',11,'Westmeath, Delvin','A close-knit society lives under the strain of conformity ',12,'2014-05-31 00:20:59','1996-12-31','12.jpg',' 0947962018','','','Abebooks.com','http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=14592507934&searchurl=sts%3Dt%26tn%3Dvalley+of+the+squinting+windows',0,1,0,0,314,'9780947962012','','English',0,0.0000,'',''),('Tis',' Frank McCourt','','Flamingo','http://www.harpercollins.com/','autobiography',5,'New York, Limerick, MS Irish Oak, Liberty Ships, Pa Keating','Frank McCourt continues his life story in the brilliant, bestselling sequel to the million-selling ‘Angela’s Ashes’.\r\n\r\n‘Angela’s Ashes’ was a publishing phenomenon. Frank McCourt’s critically-acclaimed, lyrical memoir of his Limerick childhood won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics’ Circle Award, the Royal Society of Literature Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Award amongst others, and rapidly became a word-of-mouth bestseller topping all charts worldwide for over two years. It left readers and critics alike eager to hear more about Frank McCourt’s incredible, poignant life.\r\n\r\n‘’Tis’ is the story of Frank’s American journey from impoverished immigrant with rotten teeth, infected eyes and no formal education to brilliant raconteur and schoolteacher. Saved first by a straying priest, then by the Democratic party, then by the United States Army, then by New York University – which admitted him on a trial basis though he had no high school diploma – Frank had the same vulnerable but invincible spirit at nineteen that he had at eight and still has today. And ‘‘Tis’ is a tale of survival as vivid, harrowing, and hilarious as Angela’s Ashes. Yet again, it is through the power of storytelling that Frank finds a life for himself. ‘It is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he’s done. McCourt proves himself one of the very best’ (Newsweek). ‘With ‘Tis’, McCourt blesses his readers with another chapter of his story, but as it closes, they will want still more.',14,'2014-05-31 08:57:06','1998-10-05','14.jpg','0007205244','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tis-Frank-McCourt/dp/0007205244/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1434614807&sr=1-1&keywords=tis',0,1,0,0,512,'978-0007205240','','English',0,0.0000,'0',''),('Kings of September: The Day Offaly Denied Kerry Five in a Row',' Michael Foley, Beverly Adam','','ABC','http://www.obrien.ie/','Sport',26,'Offaly','On the 19th September 1982 Kerry ran out in Croke Park chasing immortality.

A brilliantly witty reworking of the classical tale of the sculptor Pygmalion, who falls in love with his perfect female statue, it is also a barbed attack on the British class system and a statement of Shaw\'s feminist views. In Shaw\'s hands, the phoneticist Henry Higgins is the Pygmalion figure who believes he can transform Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, into a duchess at ease in polite society. The one thing he overlooks is that his \'creation\' has a mind of her own. Adapted into the Oscar-winning musical film My Fair Lady starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison in 1964, Pygmalion\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the definitive text produced under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence, with an illuminating introduction by Nicholas Grene, discussing the language and politics of the play. Also included in this volume is Shaw\'s preface, as well as his \'sequel\' written for the first publication in 1916, to rebut public demand for a more conventially romantic ending.\r\n\r\nAlthough essentially shy, Dublin-born George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) created the persona of GBS, the showman, satirist, conversationalist, critic, pundit, wit, intellectual buffoon and dramatist. Commentators brought a new adjective into English: \'Shavian\', a term used to embody all his brilliant qualities. Deeply concerned by what he saw as the exploitation of the working class, Shaw was an active Socialist and a brilliant platform speaker.

The naked body of a young man is washed up on a Donegal beach on Ireland\'s north-western coast. The local authorities in the form of the Royal Irish Constabulary show little interest in circumstances like this. The Catholic priest refuses to have anything to do with the burial of the stranger. A few locals take it upon themselves to lay him to rest in a shallow, unmarked grave on a local tidal island. He is in the company of countless infants who have been buried there over many generations, most of them victims of the horrendous Irish famine of the \'Hungry Forties\'. Their cemetery is Oileán na Márbh, \'the island of the dead\' where the nameless lie in limbo, between sea and sky, between earth and heaven. In a Scottish village a clergyman and his wife pore over the diary of their son, searching for clues about what has happened to him during a visit to Ireland. Andrew was a talented artist; he had been sent to Donegal to help his railway-planner uncle survey the route for a proposed line across the bogs of the county in an effort to bring some prosperity to the poverty-striken west. The diary seems to be all that remains of him and is a window to his innermost fears and joys. What his parents read shocks and saddens them, challenging their marriage, their life\'s work and their very faith. Meanwhile on Donegal’s western coast, Sean Ban Sweeney, who was the one to find the body on the shore, is struggling with his feelings for Annie O\'Donnell, his childhood sweetheart. Annie is different; beautiful, a uniquely talented musician but a lonely and damaged seventeen-year-old, cocooned in her silent world. Sean Ban tries to understand her as he leads his simple life on the land, oblivious to the circumstances and forces which are about to alter his life forever.

David Alfred Doudney, came to the area in 1847 intense exploitation of its copper resources had begun. Depression in the industry followed by famine and its legacy spurred Doudney to initiate educational establishments to help the poor and deprived of the area, children particularly. These initiatives brought him into conflict with Catholic clergy who suspected him of engaging in proselytism. Doudney was more interested in encouraging a more vital Christianity in opposition to the nominalism he found around him whether among Catholics or Protestants, rather than in forced religious conversion. However, such a distinction was not clear at popular level. In the rising tensions that ensued and against the backdrop of a suspected suicide, Doudney was the object of bigoted opposition, a narrow xenophobia, and of threats to his life, that together forced his departure. Not without blemish himself for, characteristic of the Victorian age, he articulated a strong anti-Catholic rhetoric, which he directed against the doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church.',107,'2015-01-30 09:00:44','2014-05-06','107.jpg','1491726032','More Info...','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunmahon','AbeBooks.com','http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=1491726032&sts=t&x=42&y=1',0,1,0,0,338,'978-1491726037','0123456789','English',20,0.0000,'',''),('My Big Fake Irish Life','Caitlin McKenna','239','','','Fiction',11,'Ireland','Twenty-six-year-old Linda Symcox has been chasing her lifelong dream of becoming an actress for the last five years, so when she gets a chance to read for a popular television series, she takes an extended lunch in order to make the audition.

Though in a 1992 presidential pardon, Nicky Kelly was described as being as innocent as though never charged in relation to the 1978 Sallins mail train robbery, the Gardai\'s conduct of its investigation in the case has never been explained; nor has that of a judiciary which sentenced him to 12 years penal servitude and kept him in jail, despite appeal after appeal, until there was political intervention. Nicky Kelly was failed at every turn by the justice agencies of this State. In an age when the most powerful democracy in the world has shown scant regard for basic justice rights, it is timely to ask: where are the mechanisms in Ireland to prevent a possible repeat of the Nicky Kelly case? In \"Free Nicky Kelly\", \"Irish Times\" journalist Patsy McGarry talks to those who actually took part in the mail train robbery; gives an inside account by Nicky Kelly of what took place after his arrest, including his time on the run in Europe, Canada and the US; relates his return to Ireland and to jail, his prolonged hunger strike and the campaign which led to his release, his eventual pardon and compensation by the State; describes Nicky\'s own international campaign on behalf of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six; and raises the unanswered questions as to how it all could have happened. In \"Free Nicky Kelly\", 30 years later, the full story of this miscarriage of justice can finally be told.

Waterford','Christmas Day 1929 was an ordinary working day for Larry Griffin, the postman in Stradbally, Co. Waterford. But he didn\'t return home after work. Apart from an abandoned bicycle on a country road, no trace of him could be found. Despite the lack of a body, ten local people were charged with his murder. The defendants included two gardaÃ­, the school teacher, the publican, his wife and two of their children. But when the state\'s only witness to the alleged murder withdrew his evidence, the case against all of them collapsed. Using newly available evidence from Garda files, which paints a sordid picture of lies, conspiracy, intimidation and Garda brutality, The Missing Postman re-examines the case and asks - What really happened to Larry Griffin?',117,'2015-02-13 19:17:22','2011-04-01','117.jpg','1856356930','Essential for those interested in true crime mysteries ans early 20th-century Irish history. -- Library Journal ','http://www.mercierpress.ie/search/q/postman/','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Missing-Postman-Really-Happened-Griffin/dp/1856356930/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423854796&sr=1-2&keywords=kilmacthomas',0,1,0,0,338,'978-1856356930','','',20,0.0000,'0',''),('Very Best Irish Songs and Ballads: v. 1: Words, Music and Guitar Chords ',' Pat Conway','126','Walton\'s Publishing','http://waltonsmusic.com/','Culture, Education',10,'Watrerford, Mooncoin','The very best Irish Songs and Ballads contains old favourites and modern classics, made famous throughout the world.

In addition to the postcards there are transcriptions of all the written details on the cards. Interspersed among these are extracts from the rich literary heritage of this part of southwest Ireland: William Trevor, Frank O\'Connor, Elizabeth Bowen, Sean O\'Faolain, Peter Somerville-Large, Mary Leland, and others. Also included are writers such as James Joyce who set a significant episode of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in Cork city, Benedict Kiely, and Robert Lloyd Praeger. Even Queen Victoria features a little excerpt from her private journal giving her first impressions of Cork\'s harbour and the Cove of Cork - renamed Queenstown in her honour. There has never been a book on the postcards of Cork, covering the city and county from Allihies to Youghal, from Clonakilty to Charleville and just about everywhere in between.

Galloping Green','Between the years of the mid thirties through to 1960, independent Ireland suffered from economic stagnation, and also went through a period of intense cultural and psychological repression. While external circumstances account for much of the stagnation - especially the depression of the thirties and the Second World War - Preventing the Future argues that the situation was aggravated by internal circumstances. The key domestic factor was the failure to extend higher and technical education and training to larger sections of the population. This derived from political stalemates in a small country which derived in turn from the power of the Catholic Church, the strength of the small-farm community, the ideological wish to preserve an older society and, later, gerontocratic tendencies in the political elites and in society as a whole. While economic growth did accelerate after 1960, the political stand-off over mass education resulted in large numbers of young people being denied preparation for life in the modern world and, arguably, denied Ireland a sufficient supply of trained labour and educated citizens. Ireland\'s Celtic Tiger of the nineties was in great part driven by a new and highly educated and technically trained workforce. The political stalemates of the forties and fifties delayed the initial, incomplete take-off until the sixties and resulted in the Tiger arriving nearly a generation later than it might have.',1235,'2015-05-15 10:58:22','2005-09-01','1235.jpg','0717139700','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Preventing-Future-Tom-Garvin/dp/0717139700/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431687015&sr=1-1&keywords=tom+garvin',0,1,0,0,352,'978-0717139705','','',1,0.0000,'',''),('1922: The Birth of Irish Democracy','Tom  Garvin','892','Gill & McMillan','http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/','history',2,'Dublin ','This book examines the birth of the Irish state, and sets it in its European historical context. The process of democratic nation-making reached full fruition, while a vicious civil war was raging, ostensibly fought over points of political principle but actually deciding, whether Ireland was to be ruled by popular majority will or by a virtuous but unaccountable minority. Garvin argues that militant republicanism always lacked popular, democratic legitimacy. The mainstream Irish nationalist tradition was moderate and realistic, and it was this nation-building tradition that triumphed in 1922. The stability and good order of the Irish state owes much to this victory. In particular, because the democratic impulse in Irish life overcame the cult of the virtuous minority, Ireland did not go the way of so many other newly emerging European states. There were to be no military dictators or fascist interludes; instead, there evolved a stable democracy which eventually came to include most of those defeated in 1922.',1236,'2015-05-15 11:04:18','2005-09-01','1236.jpg','','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/1922-Birth-Democracy-Tom-Garvin/dp/0717139697/ref=sr_1_sc_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431687686&sr=1-2-spell&keywords=tm+garvin',0,1,0,0,258,'978-0717139699','','English',1,0.0000,'',''),('Handbook to Lisdoonvarna and Its Vicinity ','Philip  Dwyer','',' Clare Local Studies Project (CLASP Press)','http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/library/local-studies/clasp/','History',2,'Co.

He began writing with the intention of putting his \'very self\' into his poems. T. S.

This volume gathers the full range of his published poetry, from the hauntingly beautiful early lyrics (by which he is still fondly remembered) to the magnificent later poems which put beyond question his status as major poet of modern times.

Ireland has a claim to possess the longest continuous literary tradition in Europe. The earliest poem in this book dates from the seventh century, the most recent from the early twenty-first. From poetry composed by anonymous monks in early Christian monasteries through to the modern masters, the tradition of Irish verse has sustained and renewed itself in every generation. Forgotten Beauty presents in gift book form poetry chosen with care and affection. It focuses on the better-known and most popular poems of the major writers, but every reader will also find hidden delights and surprises. It spans the full range of Ireland\'s poetic achievement in both languages - although the Irish-language poems are given in translation. The poetry is complemented by appropriate paintings from the Irish fine art tradition, one that is often unfairly relegated to a minor place in critical judgements. The excellence of the poetry in this book speaks for itself. The paintings, many by contemporary artists, are, however, an integral part of Forgotten Beauty, and demonstrate that there is another Irish artistic tradition which, although not as celebrated as its poetry, can claim excellence in its own right.',164,'2015-02-17 19:46:03','2014-10-03','164.jpg','0717157792','Writer and artist Brian Lalor headed a team of nine hundred contributors as General Editor of The Encyclopaedia of Ireland (2003), which won the Association of American University Presses award for best reference work in the humanities, and the American Library Association listing as best single volume work of reference.

In fact the only once that anybody could remember getting a mention in a national newspaper was when it was referred to as “the sleepy village of Ballymona”. \r\nOh but how all this was to change over those few years from 1980, when both internal and external events set such an explosive combination in place that it rocked the ancient village to its very foundation. \r\nThe simple love of the game of hurling and the pride it brought it every parish in Ireland was the catalyst which caused conflicts and splits that were never likely to be healed The past history of the team came back to haunt those who had tried to forget. The bloodlines of the proposed new team were still the same and old habits die hard. \r\nVisitors looked on the tidy village, with its picturesque church and restful lake out the road as the idyll what a tranquil place might be. But Ballymona had an underbelly shifting back and forth just under the surface. The forces of passion and conquest competed for space whenever there was the slightest vacuum. \r\nOld hurler Danny Mahon didn’t want much of anything else; but he was driven by a determination to reinvent the great hurling team that he played his last game at a forty-something year old some sixteen years earlier. Onto the scene comes the Coventry born “Star McGuigan“ the militant republican with the English accent. “Star” could do anything with his hands or his feet on the sporting field, but it was in the pursuit of the local women that young McGuigan got his most gratifying thrills. \r\nThe ˜troubles in the North” impacted on Ballymona  no matter how hard the ordinary people just wanted to get on with their neighbours; both Catholic and Protestant wanted no more from life than to be able to earn a decent week’s pay for a decent week’s work.\r\n',179,'2015-02-20 09:05:39','2011-02-20','179.jpg','','','http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-author=Bernie%20Comaskey&search-alias=books-uk&sort=relevancerank','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Team-explosive-frailties-interfered-performance-ebook/dp/B00T751DGO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1424422721&sr=1-1&keywords=bernie+comaskey',0,1,1,0,280,'','B00T751DGO','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Yeats is Dead','Anthony Cronin, Roddy Doyle','','Jonathan Cape Ltd','http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/about-us/about-us/companies/uk-companies-and-imprints/vintage-publishing/jonathan-cape','Fiction',11,'Dublin, Sligo, Killkenny','A serial novel by 15 of the brightest talents in Irish writing (including Marian Keyes, Pauline McLynn, Gina Moxley and Frank McCourt), telling an elaborate tale of murder, mayhem and literary shenanigans in present-day Dublin.

The phrase \"Banksters\" is resurrected as David Murphy and Martina Devlin describe the shocking story of how the Irish banking system was brought to its knees by a corrupt elite driven by profit and greed.Banksters examines the events which triggered the near collapse of Ireland\'s banking system, when it unfolded that a privileged \'golden circle\', caught up in a frenzy of greed and opportunism, had gambled and lost with the deposits and pensions of the Irish people.It charts how an unprecedented orgy of over-borrowing - fuelled by bankers who threw out the rule book on lending and reckless tax breaks from cavalier politicians -caused a massively over-inflated property bubble. While bank shares climbed to dizzying heights, profits soared and executives earned enormous bonuses, those who cried \'stop!\' were shouted down. But there was no promised \'soft landing\' when, in September 2008, bankers overnight went from being pillars of society to pariahs.

Born in Dublin in 1917 to politically active parents, Maeve Brennan\'s childhood in Ireland was moulded by the cultural ideologies of nationalism and lit by the creative energy of the Abbey and Gate theatres. She was seventeen when her father was appointed to the Irish Legation in Washington DC, where he was Irish Minister throughout World War II. Maeve wrote fashion copy at Harper\'s Bazaar until 1949, when William Shawn invited her to join The New Yorker. Tiny, impeccably groomed, and devastatingly witty, in William Maxwell\'s words, \'to be around her was to see style being invented\'. Her richly textured fiction criticism and \'Talk of the Town\' pieces, published in the 1950s and \'60s, during The New Yorker\'s most influential period, offer unsparing portraits of the Ireland she had left and the America she inhabited.

We catch up with old friends, Breakfast Roll Man and Miss Pencil Skirt, and meet new characters like the Merchant of Ennis, Shylock and the Godfather. We have late night tea with Brian Lenihan and cross swords with Seanie Fitzpatrick. We learn why the average drug dealer on the side of the street has more in common with the banker than either would care to mention, as we follow the money - in both rackets - from its source at the very top right down to the \'buy now, pay later\' deals at rock bottom. Why should we trust the people who got us into this mess in the first place? They were wrong then and they are wrong now. The politicians, bankers and developers think they can hand us the bill and walk away from the carnage. They want us to follow a route that will make things worse for the ordinary man on the street while saving the bankers at the top of the tree, insisting that there is no other way.

Just four days after the baby is born, Connor is killed in an accident and Nancy’s life is abruptly turned upside down. Then, a second blow—a letter from Connor’s sister, stating she intends to take over the farm. The farm is Connor’s legacy to his children and she will not allow it to be taken away from them. She will fight for the farm through the Irish courts. But, there’s one problem—she’ll have to go back to Ireland to do it. \r\nThen World War II interrupts her plans, Like millions of other American women, Nancy goes to work in a factory for the duration of the war. When the war ends, she books passage. Just before she sets sail, Neil, Connor’s best friend, asks her to marry him. Stunned by this sudden proposal, she promises to give him an answer when she comes home. \r\nIn Ireland she meets Sean Garrett, a childhood sweetheart, further complicating her feelings for Neil. As the fight for the farm makes its way through the courts, Nancy knows she will be forced to make a wrenching decision if she wins. Keep the farm and raise the children there, or go back to the states. \r\nFor Neil and Sean, the two men who love her, her decision means everything.\r\n',337,'2015-02-28 16:20:30','2011-01-28','337.jpg','','','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Michael-Grant/e/B001KDIAKI/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/When-Come-Home-Michael-Grant-ebook/dp/B0058ORN58/ref=sr_1_177?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425140190&sr=1-177&keywords=irish+fiction',0,0,1,0,408,'','B0058ORN58','',43,0.0000,'',''),('Silly Verse for Kids (Puffin Books)','Spike Milligan ','771','Puffin; New Impression edition','http://www.puffin.co.uk/','fiction',11,'Ireland','A collection of the absurd, ridiculous, sublime and characteristically anarchic verse from the brilliant Spike Milligan.

Conor Fahy, owner of a struggling bookshop, is finding it hard to cope in the aftermath of his partner Leni’s tragic death. His friend Ella Wilde tries to be supportive but is herself in a fragile mental state – she has just been axed from her job as a TV presenter, having been caught shoplifting. Then eight-year-old Jack White walks into Conor’s bookshop and settles down on the floor to read. Jack likes Ben 10, Giant Jawbreakers and Ronaldo. He likes his dad (when he doesn’t shout) but he doesn’t see him very often. He doesn’t like the bad bugs that are eating up his ma inside her tummy. Conor listens to the talkative boy but finds it hard to piece together what is really happening in his life. He is particularly mystified by Jack’s intense resentment of a woman called Rachel Traynor, not realising that she is a social worker assigned to Jack’s case and that Jack’s fate hangs in the balance.

An Irish War of Independence volunteer, anti-Treaty republican and graduate of the International Lenin School in Moscow, Murray rooted himself in the key Irish labour, republican and international struggles of his time. Based on previously unseen archival sources, Seán Byers explores Murray s IRA activities during the Irish revolutionary period; his significant contribution to the 1932 outdoor relief strike and the short-lived republican Congress initiative; and his crucial role in organising the Irish contingent of the International Brigade who fought with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. Shining a spotlight on Murray\'s close personal and political relationships with Peadar O Donnell, Frank Ryan, Jim Larkin junior, Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, Betty Sinclair and many others, Byers uses this biography as a nexus for examining cross-pollination between the Irish socialist and left republican movements throughout the period in question.

The book is an expanded version of the supplement that appeared in \"The Irish Times\" in March 2006. The supplement, which was published in association with the Department of Education and Science, was received with praise in all quarters - a remarkable achievement in view of the historical controversy that still surrounds the Rising.

The city lies under the dark cloud of the Troubles, and hatred fills the air like smoke. But Tony Macaulay has just turned twelve and he’s got a new job. He’s going to be a paperboy. And come rain or shine – or bombs and mortar – he will deliver…\r\n\r\nPaperboy lives in Upper Shankill, Belfast, in the heart of the conflict between Loyalists and Republicans. Bombings are on the evening news, rubble lies where buildings once stood, and rumours spread like wildfire about the IRA and the UDA.\r\n\r\nBut Paperboy lives in a world of Doctor Who, Top of the Pops and fish suppers.

On his rounds he hums songs by the Bay City Rollers, dreams about outer space and dreams even more about the beautiful Sharon Burgess.\r\n\r\nIn this touching, funny and nostalgic memoir, Tony Macaulay recounts his days growing up in Belfast during the Troubles, the harrowing years which saw neighbour fighting neighbour and brother fighting brother. But in the midst of all this turmoil, Paperboy, a scrappy upstart with a wicked sense of humour and sky-high dreams, dutifully goes about his paper round. He is a good paperboy, so he is.\r\n\r\nPaperboy proves that happiness can be found even in the darkest of times; it is a story that will charm your socks off, make you laugh out loud and brings to life the culture, stories and colourful characters of a very different – but very familiar – time.',1296,'2015-05-30 06:17:39','2011-11-24','1296.jpg','0007449232','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007449232/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i2?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0XV02ZA3VDAMK13RNXKH&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=577047927&pf_rd_i=desktop',0,1,0,0,288,' 978-0007449231','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Dublin Student Doctor, A (Irish Country Books) ','Patrick Taylor','676','Forge; Reprint edition','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dublin-Student-Doctor-Irish-Country/dp/0765326744/ref=sr_1_622?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425404914&sr=1-622&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','Patrick Taylor\'s devoted readers know Doctor Fingal Flahertie O\'Reilly as a pugnacious general practitioner in the quaint Irish village of Ballybucklebo.

With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that was identified closely with British rule, her interest in the language and the legends of the local area was fostered early in her life by her nanny. After the death of her husband, her interest in the language and folklore was re-ignited. Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the Irish Literary Revival. Many of the diaries and journals she kept for most of her adult life have been published, providing a rich source of information on Irish literary history during the first three decades of the 20th century. This edition of Lady Gregory’s A Book of Saints and Wonders is specially formatted with a Table of Contents and pictures.

The Falling Angels is a book about being Irish and about the way the Irish see the English and vice versa; and how it feels to fall in between. It opens with the death of Walsh’s mother, ‘the Widow of Oranmore’, as he learns the Irish Way of Death: ‘the rosaries and mass cards and lilies and amaryllises, the curious mixture of innocence and guile with which distant in-laws from Kerry and Dublin would coo and sigh and claim close friendship and act at being saints, the increasingly direct conversations that the neighbours (and I) had with Mother about death and what she could expect in Heaven. Above all, there was my mother’s own struggle with her growing doubts about God and the afterlife – she who had once been the Pope’s representative in Battersea.’\r\n\r\nEvery sentence Walsh writes is witty, outrageous, illuminating and compelling; he explores the Irish identity in a warm, personal and confessional book that takes in issues of race, of place, of language, of song, of love, of religion and, crucially, the changing nature of Ireland as it wriggles out of the dwindling influence of the church towards a new sense of itself; and in England, Irish culture has a fashionable ascendency (Angela’s Ashes, Father Ted) as indeed it always has had.\r\n\r\nStuffed like a barmbrack (fruitcake to you English) with quotations from Heaney, MacNeice, the Pogues and Paul Muldoon, it will be intensely personal, lively rather than gloomy, full of literary and historical relish, and a completely glorious read.\r\n',1066,'2015-03-06 14:13:51','2011-06-10','1066.jpg','0006531229','The book is probably the best perspective ever of an in depth first hand analysis of middle class Anglo Irish relations in the 60\'s 70\'s and 80\'s, and possibly even prior to this.','','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falling-Angels-John-Walsh/dp/0006531229/ref=sr_1_1032?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425650458&sr=1-1032&keywords=irish+fiction',0,1,0,0,304,'978-0006531227','','English',41,0.0000,'0',''),('Screwed',' ','','Headline','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Screwed-Eoin-Colfer/dp/0755391888/ref=sr_1_1037?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425651457&sr=1-1037&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','From the bestselling author of the Artemis Fowl children\'s titles comes a brilliant, darkly comic follow-up to the adult crime debut PLUGGED\r\n',1071,'2015-03-06 14:29:41','2013-09-12','1071.jpg','0755391888','I remember watching the Robert DeNiro/Charles Grodin movie Midnight Run when it first came out and looking at my watch after about an hour and a half and thinking: ','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eoin-Colfer/e/B001JS4V8E/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Screwed-Eoin-Colfer/dp/0755391888/ref=sr_1_1037?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425651457&sr=1-1037&keywords=irish+fiction',0,1,0,0,368,'978-0755391882','','English',41,0.0000,'0',''),('The Things I\'ve Seen','Lara Marlowe','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com','Non-fiction',19,'Ireland, France, Middle East, Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine and Iraq.

Originally published in 1998, to great success, this new and revised edition brings original scholarship to contemporary readers and contains an insightful added essay on Joyce\'s aesthetic musings. In his foreword, the internationally renowned Coleridge scholar J. C. C. Mays praises the original essays by Eco and Santoro-Brienza for being both highly respectful of Joyce and for their friendly familiarity with him. Mays also notes that \'These commentaries, by Italians in English, of an author of books in English who preferred to speak Italian, are a rich and illuminating conjunction. Read these lectures for the way they are, for they brings together two worlds. Their eminent authors do not stand on dignity: they communicate directly what is important.

The art and science of ploughing has helped put food on the tables of millions of people in Ireland and across the world for thousands of years. \r\n\r\nThe fascinating world of ploughing has it all: amazing people, beautiful horses, mesmerising machinery, and stars such as Harry Ferguson from County Down and his enemy (and later friend) Henry Ford. Plough Music covers the whole gamut of ploughing, from the hills of Ballycullane to the banks of the Brahmatputra, and from the near-miraculous role played by the humble earthworm in aerating the soil, attempting to create plough-free farming. \r\n\r\nWhy do 150,000 people attend the national ploughing championships each year? Why do hundreds of old-boy racers regularly take their vintage tractors out on the roads? And why do multimillionaires forsake their yachts and foreign holidays to take to the plough? Now, for the first time, writer and journalist David Medcalf, a lifetime observer of rural families and their way of life, sheds light on these and other burning questions. His miscellany of musings will fascinate, educate, intrigue and illuminate both the dedicated ploughman (or woman) and the armchair follower of this ancient art. It is a feast for both the mind and the soul; it is music for tired souls, inextricably entwined with our national identity.\r\n',1741,'2015-09-01 08:23:59','2015-09-01','1741.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/plough-music-sketches-secrets-and-stories',0,0,0,0,0,'9781905483785','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('Little Lamb ','Joseph Black ','520','','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Lamb-Joseph-Black-ebook/dp/B00MTZEIJI/ref=sr_1_1122?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425666653&sr=1-1122&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','From Joseph Black, the author of Happy Little Pig, comes another tale of the darker side of human nature\r\n',1140,'2015-03-06 18:35:50','2014-08-17','1140.jpg','','This is a good, short, hard hitting cannibal story.Not for the easily offended.','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Joseph-Black/e/B00MU650KM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1','amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Lamb-Joseph-Black-ebook/dp/B00MTZEIJI/ref=sr_1_1122?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425666653&sr=1-1122&keywords=irish+fiction',0,0,1,0,12,'','B00MTZEIJI','English',41,NULL,'',''),('Irish Short Stories ',' Sigerson Clifford','','Mercier Press','http://www.mercierpress.ie/','fiction',11,'Ireland','The short stories collected here are among the best ever written about Ireland, set apart by Sigerson Clifford\'s concise, masterful treatment of themes such as unrequited love, murderous hatred, betrayal, disappointment and hope.

Between these extremes, and balanced by them, Homer and Achilles, Shakespeare and Cromwell, ‘cattle-herders, butter-makers, singers, dancers’ live out their ‘sliver of the earth’s time’ by the same equalizing measure of mountains and forests, ‘the gold-struck, mercury sea’. The collection unifies these pasts in the symbolic curia of the museum and library, from where so many of Cannon’s poems take wing, pursuing objects beyond their material presence into their haunted pasts, objects that, to paraphrase the collection’s closing poem, ‘we have often seen before but have never heard’.',1610,'2015-08-26 11:45:12','2015-09-25','1610.jpg','','','','Carcanet Press','http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784100605',0,1,1,0,72,'978 1 784100 60 5','9781784100629','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Wild Irish Girl (Oxford World\'s Classics) ',' Lady Morgan  Sydney (nee Owenson)','','Oxford Paperbacks; New Ed. / edition','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Irish-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199552495/ref=sr_1_1187?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425714000&sr=1-1187&keywords=irish+fiction','fiction',11,'Ireland','When Horatio, the son of an English lord, is banished to his father\'s Irish estate as punishment for gambling debts and dissipated living, he adopts the persona of knight errant and goes off in search of adventure.

Instead, let’s welcome all our feelings of distress, all our thoughts and beliefs about life’s challenges, and focus on transforming these in a way that is helpful for us.’\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable book Dr Claire Hayes demonstrates how each of us can use cognitive behavioural principles to help us cope. In a very clear, practical way she shows us how to make sense of our distressing feelings, to become aware of our unhelpful thoughts and our core beliefs, and most of all, to focus on what we can actually do to improve things for ourselves. Rather than trying to suppress or ignore our feelings of distress, she invites us to welcome them as messengers asking us to do something helpful to improve things.\r\n\r\nUsing her unique techniques such as the ‘Coping Triangle’ and ‘Coping Sentences’, Dr Hayes shows us how to proactively manage life’s challenges, such as pressure, rejection, loss, failure, success and change. A number of case studies illustrate the success of Dr Hayes’s approach, while practical exercises and advice make it accessible to all readers.

Among his innovations, Lemass instigated a new era in North-South relations and began the overhaul of the educational system. In \'Judging Lemass\', renowned historian, Tom Garvin, introduces the many facets of Sean Lemass - a cusp figure who ushered in the modern world; a visionary who was imagining a United States of Europe, since the 1920s; a sharp dresser with a striking film noir style and a preference for Cuban cigars; an ex-revolutionary who lost two younger brothers to the conflict; a proud urbanite who regarded rural Ireland as somewhat alien and agriculture as a drag on economic development; and, above all, the architect of modern Ireland. Reproduced alongside the text in a tactile print quality are letters, state documents and a store of unseen photographs. Judging Lemass follows the stellar success of Judging Dev and precedes the next in the series of in-depth and visually lavish profiles of leaders, Judging Cosgrave.',1237,'2015-05-15 11:40:33','2009-09-20','1237.jpg','1904890571','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Judging-Lemass-Measure-Tom-Garvin/dp/1904890571/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431689818&sr=1-8&keywords=tom+garvin',0,0,0,0,300,'978-1904890577','','English',1,0.0000,'',''),('Nationalist Revolutionaries in Ireland, 1858-1928','Tom  Garvin','892','Gill & McMillan','http://www.gillmacmillan.ie/','history',2,'Dublin, Cork, Tippeary, Mallow, Limerick','The present-day Republic of Ireland was created by a revolutionary elite which developed between 1858 and 1914. This book analyses the social origins of the revolutionary politicians who became the rulers of Ireland after 1922 and examines their political preconceptions, ideologies and prejudices. Tom Garvin argues that in many cases they were not only influenced by old agrarian grievances or memories of the Famine, but also, and more immediately, by the contemporary Catholic abhorrence of the Protestant and secular world symbolised by London, England and, to some extent, America. Drawing on the evidence of private letters and diaries as well as the popular nationalist journalism of the period, \"Nationalist Revolutionaries in Ireland\" makes a hugely original contribution to Irish historiography. It reconstructs the private thoughts behind the public faces of the emergent leadership of independent Ireland, and also puts that leadership in comparative international perspective. This book, a classic of its type, now appears for the first time in paperback. It demonstrates all of Tom Garvin\'s intellectual and interpretative daring, his willingness to address major political and historical issues in a wholly original and thought-provoking way and his search for historical trails ignored by others.',1238,'2015-05-15 11:44:12','2005-09-01','1238.jpg',' 0717139689','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nationalist-Revolutionaries-Ireland-1858-1928-Garvin/dp/0717139689/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431690042&sr=1-4&keywords=tom+garvin',0,0,0,0,210,'978-0717139682','','English',1,0.0000,'',''),('Undoing Time: The Life and Work of Samuel Beckett ','Jennifer Birkett','896','Irish Academic Press','http://irishacademicpress.ie/','biography',6,'Dublin, Foxrock, Leopardstown.','Since his death in 1989, it has become difficult to imagine that Samuel Beckett was once a virtually unknown writer.

Since Godot, his writing has been translated, published, and staged throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThis highly accessible and original narrative account offers a new opportunity to engage with a towering figure of Irish and world literature.

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.”\r\n\r\nSo begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank’s mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank’s father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible, and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father’s tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is story that accounts for Frank’s survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig’s head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance, and remarkable forgiveness.\r\n\r\nAngela’s Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt’s astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.',1291,'2015-05-28 23:39:59','1999-05-25','1291.jpg','068484267X','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.com/Angelas-Ashes-Memoir-Frank-McCourt/dp/068484267X',0,1,0,0,0,'978-0684842677','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Sean Keating: In Focus','Eimear  O\'Connor, Virginia  Teehan','','Associated Editions','http://www.associatededitions.ie/','art',1,'Dublin, Cork, ','This elegantly produced 64-page catalogue has been published to accompany the exhibition Sean Keating: In Focusat the Hunt Museum, Limerick.

It is written from the perspective of a former nun who has unique insight into religious life and covers the period 1930 to 2008. In For God\'s Sake ten nuns recount their life stories. They come from all social strata and from different convents and congregations. They tell tales of a very repressive regime, of a strict social class system, of stifled emotions and of the harsh life in the Magdalen laundries and industrial schools. For many nuns the dreams of their young lives have been shattered by events beyond their control. Each story covers some aspects of convent life and the individual responses to it, and they offer some understanding of why nobody noticed the abuse, or if they did, why they turned a blind eye. These stories are important because they reveal a way of life that has long since passed, where every aspect of women\'s lives was governed by a male-dominated hierarchical Church that promised salvation, and even sainthood, to those who were faithful to its precepts. The nuns took vows and owed blind obedience to their superior who alone knew God\'s will, and in telling their stories finally become aware of many of the damaging effects the convent system had on their personalities.',1295,'2015-05-29 20:40:24','2015-05-29','1295.jpg','1908308648','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gods-Sake-Hidden-Life-Irish/dp/1908308648/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1432931564&sr=1-1&keywords=for+god%27s+sake',0,1,0,0,250,'978-1908308641','','English',1,0.0000,'1',''),('All Growed Up: What Breadboy Did at University','Tony  Macaulay','','Blackstaff Press','http://blackstaffpress.com/','fiction',11,'Belfast, Shankill, Coleraine','\'It\'s Belfast, 1982, and a seventeen-year-old boy wearing Hai Karate aftershave has an appointment with destiny.

In one of the oldest traditions in the world, Seamus carved his own niche to become one of the most respected sculptor s in his field. Stone Mad is an account of his days as an apprentice where he learned to work the stone and discovered that there is no regularity in nature. With hammer, mallet and chisel he shaped and fashioned rough boulders under the guidance of the master stonecarvers. Their unique voices emanate from the pages as Seamus allows the men to tell their own stories by using the language of the stonies . A symbiotic relationship exists between the stonecarver and his chosen material. The full artistic potential of a piece of stone is realised by the stonecarver who can respect his material and take a suggestion from it. A good carver will learn to speak kindly to the stone. Seamus spent seven years romancing the stone and Stone Mad documents his years of joy and struggle. His artistic feeling for quality responded to his workmates reverence for the well made thing . The result is a book of surpassing beauty, full of warmth, humour and profound perception.',1302,'2015-05-30 23:13:56','2005-05-01','1302.jpg','1903464811','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stone-Mad-Seamus-Murphy/dp/1903464811/ref=pd_cp_14_2',0,1,0,0,240,'','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Dublin Urban Legends','Brendan  Nolan','','The History Press','http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/','history culture',15,'Dublin, Talbot Street, Donnycarney, Tara Street','Is there a secret tunnel in O’Connell Street?

Now, in this long-awaited memoir, Mary takes us back to the roots of her musical heritage and to the influences that helped to shape her as an artist and a woman.\r\n\r\nBorn into a musical family, Mary Black – a feisty tomboy who could hold her own when it came to sparring with her brothers and anyone else brave enough to take her on – began singing folk songs from the age of ten. Music played an important role in the family home and, performing with her brothers and her sister Frances, Mary built her highly successful career on the bedrock of these early years.\r\n\r\nFrom the pubs and clubs of her hometown, Dublin, she went on to perform in some of the most prestigious venues across the world. Always committed to exploring new material from the best writers, her unique talent attracted acclaim from critics, fellow artists and the public alike. It also led to a host of bestselling albums, including the multi-platinum No Frontiers, which spent more than a year in the Irish Top 30.\r\n\r\nMary’s love of singing was matched only by the love she had for her family. As she recalls the inevitable tensions that arose when trying to juggle family life and a high-profile career, she tells of her struggle to combine the two contrasting aspects of her life. It was only through gritty determination, hard work and a fair amount of laughter that Mary was able to enjoy major success as an artist and, at the same time, raise a close and loving family with her husband Joe.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly honest, and written with warmth and humour, Down the Crooked Road offers a unique insight into the life and career of one of our most gifted singers – an artist who, during the course of her long career, has captured the hearts of millions around the world.',1316,'2015-06-02 17:48:45','2015-06-03','1316.jpg','1848271883','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Down-Crooked-Road-My-Autobiography/dp/1848271883/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433266873&sr=8-1&keywords=Down+the+Crooked+Road',0,0,0,0,336,'978-1848271883','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Hitler\'s Irish Voices: The Story of German Radio\'s Wartime Irish Service','David O\'Donoghue','','Somerville Press','http://www.somervillepress.com/','history',2,'Dublin, Berlin','This incredible story - based on detailed research in Germany, Ireland and Britain - uncovers for the first time one of the most sensitive issues concerning Irish-German relations in the Second World War.

From small beginnings featuring a weekly talk in Irish, the broadcasts from Berlin grew into a nightly bi-lingual service in Irish and English. The man behind the plan to target Irish listeners - as well as Irish groups in America and Australia - was Dr Adolf Mahr, the Austrian-born director of the National Museum in Dublin. A member of the Nazi Party, he was promoted to the top museum job in 1934. Mahr left Dublin in 1939, never to return. Officially on leave of absence from his job with the Irish Civil Service, he spent the war years in Berlin working on the Irish desk at the German Foreign Office, as well as establishing and directing German Radio\'s nightly Irish Service, known as the Irland-Redaktion. \"Hitler\'s Irish Voices\" tells the story of Mahr and the rest of his motley crew who worked for the Irland-Redaktion.\r\nIt traces their backgrounds, the various paths that led them to wartime Berlin, and tells what became of them after the war.

Under pressure from Irish and British military intelligence, he left for Germany shortly before the outbreak of war in 1939, never to return. To this day, he is considered in some circles to have been a spy who used his position at the museum to help prepare Germany\'s invasion plan of Ireland. During the war, he became director of Irland-Redaktion, the German propaganda radio service that broadcast into neutral Ireland. He was later arrested and tortured by the British, and upon his release tried to return to Ireland, but to no avail. He remains one of the most controversial figures in twentieth-century Irish history. The book also tells the story of Hilde Mahr, Adolf\'s eldest daughter, who had been a member of Hitler Youth in Ireland before being trapped in Germany when the war began. She was drafted into the National Labour Force, was stationed on the roofs of Berlin buildings during air-raids, and several times came close to death.',1324,'2015-06-03 22:30:14','2007-03-28','1324.jpg','1905483201','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dublin-Nazi-No-Life-Adolf/dp/1905483201/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8',0,1,0,0,1,'978-1905483204','','English',1,0.0000,'0','A very Interesting Read!

Tomás Ó Criomhthain\'s memoir an tOileánach (\"the Islandman\", 1929) and Robert J. Flaherty\'s documentary Man of Aran address similar subjects. The movement swiftly found itself the object of some derision and mockery – especially among the more cosmopolitan city dwellers of Ireland - for its often relentless depictions of rural hardship.

The often bleak tone of the book is established from its opening words:\r\n“ 	I am an old woman now, with one foot in the grave and the other on its edge. I have experienced much ease and much hardship from the day I was born until this very day. Had I known in advance half, or even one-third, of what the future had in store for me, my heart wouldn\'t have been as gay or as courageous it was in the beginning of my days. 	”\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe book was for a long time required reading in secondary schools in Ireland.

Based on a wealth of personal interviews and newly-discovered archive material. Offers unique insight into how Anglo-Irish relations impacted on emigrants coming to Britain during turbulent times. This lively book tells the untold story of the crucial work carried out by the Irish Emigrant Chaplaincy in Britain on behalf of Irish emigrants for over half a century. The hidden history revealed is one of political intrigue; economic booms and busts; MI5; international relations; miscarriages of justice; Papal Encyclicals; Gospel teaching and the struggle for equality and justice. The vital work of the Irish Emigrant Chaplaincy was often conducted against a background of battling against the odds and the establishment. It is the story of Irish and British migration history in modern times and Anglo-Irish relations unfolding over turbulent and politically sensitive decades. Patricia Kennedy bases her history on archival research and over eighty interviews with key informants who benefited from or administered this vital service.

For the combatants it was a no-holds-barred clash: the professional army of an empire against a highly motivated, well-drilled force of volunteers. What did the men and women who fought on the streets of Dublin endure during those brutal days after the clock struck on 24 April 1916? For them, the conflict was a mix of bloody fighting and energy-sapping waiting, with meagre supplies of food and water, little chance to rest and the terror of imminent attacks. The experiences recounted here include those of: 20-year-old Sean McLoughlin who went from Volunteer to Captain to Commandant-General in five days: his cool head under fire saved many of his comrades; volunteer Robert Holland, a sharpshooter who continued to fire despite punishing rifle recoil; Volunteer Thomas Young\'s mother, who acted as a scout, leading a section through enemy-infested streets; the 2/7th Sherwood Foresters NCO who died when the grenade he threw at Clanwilliam House bounced off the wall and exploded next to his head; 2nd Lieutenant Guy Vickery Pinfield of the 8th Royal Hussars, who led the charge on the main gate of Dublin Castle and became the first British officer to die in the Rising.

Cruelly beaten by bullies in the railway yard where he worked during his teens, he refused to fight back. Yet he went on to become a heavyweight boxing champion and to earn the \"undisputed reputation as the country\'s toughest and bravest garda.\" Chief Superintendent Edmund Doherty proclaimed him \"one of those people who become a legend in his own time.\" As a garda he refused to carry a baton, relying upon his fists. He took on the vicious \"animal gangs\" of the 1930s and 40s and in the \"Battle of Baldoyle\" broke their reign of terror. In the 1950s he quelled the wild \"rock-and-roll riots\" and tamed the ruffian Teddy Boys with their flick-knives. All the while, he was dealing with Dublin\'s full array of gurriers and criminals. As a devotee of American Western films and books, Branigan emulated the sheriffs by doling out his unique \"showdown\" brand of summary justice to hooligans and thugs on the street. In the 1960s his riot squad with its Garda \"posse\" patrolled Dublin\'s roughest districts in their \"black Maria.\" They contended with the most dangerous rows and riots in the streets, dancehalls and pubs.

It stresses the importance of the landscape and of the deer, cattle and timber within it as integral aspects of the material culture of high-medieval Ireland. The research is underpinned by extensive fieldwork, which has identified surviving park features in the landscape. Key topics explored include the form and function of medieval parks, their occurrence and location in the landscape, the status and identity of their owners and a comparison with parks elsewhere. Notably, the evidence suggests that both parks and fallow deer were relatively uncommon in Ireland compared to England. The reasons for this lie in chronology, landscape and politics, and these form a major theme within the book.',1366,'2015-06-09 09:07:57','2015-06-09','1366.jpg',' 1846825695','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Anglo-Norman-Parks-Medieval-Ireland-Beglane/dp/1846825695/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433840528&sr=1-1&keywords=Anglo-Norman+parks+in+medieval+Ireland',1,0,0,0,256,'978-1846825699','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Irish Culture and Wartime Europe, 1938-48','Guy Woodward','','Four Courts Publishing','http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/welcome/','history',2,'Dublin, Tullynally, Glencairn, Sanymount, North Strand, Irish Sea, Holyhead, Liverpool','The decade between 1938 and 1948 was a time of immense upheaval across Europe which deeply affected Irish writers and artists. Many of them had travelled extensively across the Continent and some returned there even in the face of war. At the same time, a number of their English counterparts took refuge from unfolding events in Ireland. Taking these intersecting journeys as a starting point, the essays in this collection explore afresh the cultural history of this decade and the continuing impact of the events around and during the Second World War on Irish literature and culture. They represent, as R.F. Foster writes in his Foreword, ‘a suggestive exploration into an imaginative territory which has been too long left uncharted.’\r\nThe essays address writers including Samuel Beckett, John Betjeman, Graham Greene, T.H. White, Stephen Gilbert, Denis Johnston, Patrick Kavanagh, Louis MacNeice, Kate O’Brien, Francis Stuart and Evelyn Waugh, as well as the painter Nevill Johnson. During this turbulent decade, their engagements with home and abroad, self and other, complicate established narratives of Irish neutrality and isolation and shed new light on the intricate cultural and historical interconnections between Ireland and Europe.',1367,'2015-06-09 10:15:16','2015-06-08','1367.jpg','1846825628','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Irish-Culture-Wartime-Europe-1938-48/dp/1846825628/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433844635&sr=1-1&keywords=Irish+culture+and+wartime+Europe%2C+1938%E2%80%9348',1,0,0,0,256,'978-1846825620','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Strawberry Thief ','Sara  Berkeley','','Gallery Press','http://www.gallerypress.com/','poetry',23,'Dublin, San Francisco','Strawberry Thief, Sara Berkeley’s first collection in more than a decade, opens with a suite of poems which celebrates her daughter’s birth – ‘Hail to her, and sunlight, and spirit songs’ – and looks backwards in ‘The Burning Building’ on the pain in, and recovery from, an unhappy marriage and the discovery of joy in a new relationship.\r\nFrom the delicate detail of the unborn child who ‘brushed me with her lashes’ to its broad geographic sweep, the book bustles with life and colour and music.

This was swiftly followed by railway expansion throughout Ireland. In the south east it was the Dublin & South Eastern and the Great Southern & Western Railways that dominated. By 1925 they had amalgamated to become Great Southern Railways, but soon after there followed a period of fluctuating fortunes due to war and fuel shortages. In the 1950s competition from road transport led to drastic cost-cutting measures. Unlike the railways in Britain however, the region has enjoyed a revival since the 1980s with line electrifications and development of a modern tramway within the capital; as at date of publication there is now even an underground system being considered for the city. The whole history of the region\'s railways is told here in detail accompanied by a collection of 52 photographs.

The depth and range of James Joyce\'s relationship with key historical, intellectual and cultural issues in the early twentieth century are explored, including: the growth of Dublin as a city, the advance of Irish separatist nationalism, criminal trials in late nineteenth-century Ireland, the influence of Classical authors such as Aristotle and Ovid, the Irish Literary Revival, the value of operatic music, notions of the aesthetic and of a democratic readership, and the history and social import of Jewish communities and traditions. The twenty essays in this collection draw out the openness and pluralism of Joyce\'s writing and underscore the need for readings of his work from a large variety of diverging perspectives. The wide ranging voices in this collection are composed by present and former UCD academics, and constitute a unique reckoning with the legacy of Joyce by members of his alma mater.A portrait of Joyce emerges as a writer deeply embedded in Irish intellectual discourses and as a figure of vital on-going importance in the social and cultural debates of twenty-first century Ireland.

Whitaker’s life spans the history of the Irish state in whose economic, social and cultural evolution he played an integral and influential role. Born in Rostrevor, County Down, reared in Drogheda, County Louth, from modest beginnings, T.K. Whitaker’s meteoric rise through the ranks of the civil service saw him at 39 years become the youngest Secretary of the Department of Finance.\r\n\r\nHis was the quiet presence, the rational and informed voice behind many of the most momentous events in recent Irish history. His inspirational paper Programme for Economic Development became the blueprint for Ireland’s regeneration in the 1960s. As Governor in the 1970s his vision and purpose transformed the Central Bank into a dynamic institution. And, as advisor to Taoiseach Jack Lynch and other political leaders, he played a crucial role behind the scenes in the movement towards peace in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nDrawn from in-depth interviews conducted with Dr Whitaker and his family, as well as exclusive access to his personal papers and correspondence, in Portrait of a Patriot author Anne Chambers reveals the quite extraordinary extent and diversity of T.K. Whitaker’s work on behalf of the Irish State; his relationship with Irish and international political figures such as De Valera, Lemass, MacBride, Costello, Sweetman, Lynch, Haughey, FitzGerald, O’Neill, and Whitelaw; his policy struggles with governments and individual ministers.\r\n\r\nThis personal and intimate biography also introduces Ken Whitaker the family man, his motivation, humour and compassion; the personal losses endured and the many highlights enjoyed.\r\n\r\nT.K.

Carlow, Ireland','The Carlow Corridor describes the results of archaeological investigations undertaken in 2006 at 57 sites discovered in advance of the construction of the M9 Carlow Bypass. The scheme encircles the eastern side of Carlow town and represents the first phase of the new M9 motorway from Kildare to Waterford. The excavations afforded the opportunity to track changes in the local environment and landscape over the millennia, from the dense woodland of the Mesolithic era to the modern-day intensive agricultural landscape. Indirect evidence of Carlow’s earliest settlers in the Mesolithic era was recovered through the finding of stone tool sites, supplementing results of previous surveys along the Barrow river valley. The discovery of the earliest houses yet identified within the county attest to the presence of settled farming folk in the area during the Neolithic. A booming economy in the Bronze Age is manifest through the domestic, ritual and industrial sites of an extensive and complex cultural landscape. The route avoided upstanding medieval sites; however, archaeology relating to the hinterland of such sites affords intriguing insights into the rural life in the county during the medieval and post-medieval periods. The book is lavishly illustrated and provides the reader with a description in summary form of all the excavated sites.

But most of all, he writes with verve and pace. Tony Ryan was born in a railwayman\'s cottage and rose to enormous success, overseeing the spectacular making of two business fortunes and the dramatic losing of one. After an early spell in Aer Lingus, he set up an airline leasing company, Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), which had its headquarters in Shannon and quickly became the largest such enterprise in the world. Ryan was a hard taskmaster and the company reflected his ferocious work ethic. Yet, despite a stellar board of directors, a botched and poorly timed Initial Public Offering in the 1990s saw GPA crash and burn. Ryan lost almost everything. What remained was a little airline that was chronically loss making. Ryan set about turning Ryanair around, putting in one of his assistants, Michael O\'Leary, to help knock it into shape. The rest is history. Ryan remade his fortune, lived lavishly and elegantly, was a generous patron of the arts, and in every respect larger than life. His spirit is one that Ireland needs more than ever today. As the nation strives for its own recovery, it can find inspiration in the story of how one of its most famous sons rose and fell, and then rose again. Not one to stand still or lament mistakes, Tony Ryan\'s determination never to give up is the real lesson of this story.

It considers three main areas: the perception of Gothic architecture; the development of a tradition of scholarship on Irish Gothic; and the actual changes wrought to the fabric of the buildings as well as the social and legal framework for those changes. Shifting the focus from high-status monument such as the medieval cathedrals of Dublin, this book considers the treatment of smaller medieval buildings. These include the ruined monastic buildings and cathedral buildings outside of Dublin, but also smaller parish churches that were being restored for reuse as places of worship, such as those at Adare, Co.

Led by Bobby Kennedy, Kenny O\'Donnell, Larry O\'Brien, and Dave Powers they were tough minded, Irish-Catholic guys who were joined together by a common ambition to see Jack Kennedy through to the White House. War veterans who were young, ambitious, and they wanted their country back. Jack Kennedy was their man, their leader. No matter that he was Irish, Catholic, and his \"Old Man\" had made as many enemies as friends -- Jack had ambition, brains, a special charisma. To win the White House would be a victory not only for Jack Kennedy, but for the downtrodden. They collectively decided that if the political powers would not let them in willingly then they would kick the door down. At the center of the story is Kenny O\'Donnell, Jack Kennedy\'s tough talking, no-bullshit, top political aide. Jack recognized he needed Kenny\'s blue collar, political genius and Kenny recognized something special in Jack. The Irish Brotherhood describes what it was like to be inside the Kennedy inner circle. With Bobby, who was determined to make his own mark apart from his famous family, his life-long struggle, never won, never lost. With Joe, as Kenny and Larry prove to him that their outsider approach was going to work after Jack\'s crushing victory in \'58, which sets the stage for the Presidential campaign to come.

In addition to presenting the history of folklore collecting, this book also illustrates life in the Gaeltacht during the Second World War. Although best known as a piper, Ennis was a collector par excellence. This book is a personal account of his field work during those years. This is the first publication of a diary of a fulltime collector of music and song with the Irish Folklore Commission. It paints a vivid picture of social life at the time and comments in particular on popular pastimes and other aspects of daily life.A number of entries cast light on his fieldwork methodology, which was meticulous, and his attitude towards his mission, which led him to eschew anything that had been collected frequently or learned from a book. Ennis visited a number of Gaeltachtai and this book sketches a picture of life in Donegal, Mayo, Connemara and West Clare. This collection will have particular relevance not only to those interested in Ennis as an individual, but also to all historians and scholars of Irish traditional music and folklore in the twentieth century. Despite the great entertainment Ennis enjoyed on his working trips, he had to be ever vigilant, constantly on the look out for new material and new contacts from which to elicit information.Ui Ogain captures Ennis\' writing style admirably. Accounts of certain events reveal an engaged emotional intensity underscoring Ennis\' firm belief that his endeavour was more than a mere job. Such vignettes render the diary eminently accessible and attractive to a general reading public, a distinction rarely achieved in this kind of publication.

Historians, archaeologists, biologists and earth scientists each bring their unique take on how the landscape and the life it supports have been crafted by natural and human events. Some of the great enigmas of the past are now being unravelled, and this book gives a fascinating and fresh glimpse of how Ireland s unique and stunning ecosystem has evolved. The latest scientific theories, techniques and methods are used to bring readers up-to-date on each of these remarkable stories. Unravelling this history, as revealed through the chapters of this book, uses a wide array of evidence and clues, some ingenious; to build an amazing history that is part of all our pasts. The endeavours of humans whether in politics, art or territorial ambition are every bit as important as great ice-sheets, climatic catastrophes and even microscopic plant diseases in shaping and understanding this landscape of ours. The book also celebrates the pioneering work of Robert Lloyd Praeger. In 1895 Praeger began a pilgrimage across Ireland that was to last five years. His aim was to chart the distribution of all plants across the country. His observations of the landscape and its people became a classic of Irish travel writing in The Way That I Went. Praeger pondered the question of where the flora of Ireland come from, and conducted some of the greatest investigations into these matters with the Clare Island survey which was completed in 1913 this being its centenary year. Inspired by Praeger, modern experts are unravelling these stories using new techniques and methods, and bring together their recent findings to unravel the remarkable secrets of the Irish landscape.',1483,'2015-07-22 07:53:13','2015-07-22','1483.jpg','1782050108','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secrets-Irish-Landscape-Matthew-Jebb/dp/1782050108/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437549595&sr=1-1&keywords=secrets+of+the+irish+landscape',1,0,0,0,244,'978-1782050100','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('A Life with Claw: The Peter Clohessy Story','Anna Gibson Steel','','Hero Books','','Biography',6,'Limerick, ','Peter Clohessy was the most inspirational and controversial figure ever to represent Ireland on a rugby field in modern times.\r\nIn his 15 years with Munster, and a memorable decade in green, Clohessy was known simply as The Claw - he was an enforcer and a leader, a man who refused to shirk in the face of even the most insurmountable odds.\r\n\r\nThe Claw is known as the toughest and the most ruthless figure ever to play for Ireland.

Recounting scenes from her childhood in Ulster, she paints a memorable and poignant picture of violence and oppression with her uncaring father and protective mother, whose retaliation to her husband’s penny-pinching came in the form of a secret yellow dress. \r\n<p>\r\nChristina’s formative years and her foray into the world, which begin with the daily trudge to and from school, are peopled by a troupe of bizarre and unforgettable characters dancing in and out of her life, filling her with awe and wonder. Among them are Miss McKeague, a gentle, calm and graceful religious zealot, Great Aunt Rose, the “Yankees,” Norrie the transvestite, and in the wings, her stern, unyielding uncles, each vying for the ancestral money and land to the exclusion of all else.\r\n<p>\r\nAt age eleven, she experiences a frightening paranormal occurrence, a prolonged haunting that confirms for her the reality of the spirit world. \r\n<p>\r\nThough it affects her deeply, she later learns to channel her confusion into twin artistic passions: poetry and painting. The discordant nature of Christina McKenna’s young life, and the feelings of inferiority it bred, lead her to examine all the limiting belief systems she grew up with, and question the validity of the hidebound Catholicism of her childhood. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is a rite-of-passage account of two generations of Irish women, told with great humour and compassion. \r\n<p>\r\nOn the one hand is the writer; on the other the heroic mother who showed her love as best she could. McKenna concludes that our past, no matter how painful, need not keep us bound—once we choose love over hate.

It was both a physical battle of shocking violence against a regime increasingly seen as alien and unacceptable and an intellectual battle for a new sort of country. The damage done, the betrayals and grim compromises put the new nation into a state of trauma for at least a generation, but at a nearly unacceptable cost the struggle ended: a new republic was born.\r\n\r\nCharles Townshend\'s Easter 1916 opened up the astonishing events around the Rising for a new generation and in The Republic he deals, with the same unflinchingly wish to get to the truth behind the legend, with the most critical years in Ireland\'s history.

Increasing expectations of its contribution to personal growth and career enhancement and to the economic development of society have led to greatly increased participation rates.

It examines features of the student experience, the role of the academic profession, the research mission, and the linkages between higher education and the labour market.

All translators have tackled the problem of being Irish poets working in English and drawing upon the Irish-language tradition in various ways, as well as having to negotiate between Merriman’s world and their own historical moments. This tension in translation is the major focus of The Midnight Court: Eleven Versions of Merriman.\r\n\r\nThe author sets out the problems of translation in an introductory chapter and gives a general note on the tradition of translating Merriman’s poem. He then focuses attention on eleven translators, who are given a chapter each for discussion: Denis Woulfe, Michael C. O’Shea, Arland Ussher, Frank O’Connor, Lord Longford, David Marcus, Patrick C. Power, Cosslett Ó Cuinn, Thomas Kinsella, Seamus Heaney and Ciaran Carson.\r\n\r\nAs the book progresses, a picture forms of a layering in the life of the translated poem as translators rescue overlooked themes or stylistic approaches. This interesting undertaking, with its keen scrutiny of the text on a line-by-line basis, brings something new to Merriman scholarship, with examples of the myriad options available to the translator that illuminate nearly two hundred years of poetic translation and exchanges across two cultures.',1514,'2015-08-02 20:06:10','2015-08-30','1514.jpg','184351639X','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Midnight-Court-Eleven-Versions-Merriman/dp/184351639X/ref=sr_1_sc_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1438545563&sr=1-2-spell&keywords=The+midnihght+court',1,0,0,0,256,'978-1843516392','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Going Back','Rachael English','','https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/','https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/','Fiction',11,'Ireland - USA','From Ireland to the USA, a heart-warming story of family, friendships and love, of difficult decisions and lifelong consequences from a well-loved Irish radio personality.',1515,'2015-08-03 19:06:59','2014-05-22','1515.jpg','','','','https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/','https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781409145202',0,1,0,0,368,' 9781409145202','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('The Game Changer','Louise Phillips','','Hachette Books Ireland','http://www.hachette.ie/','Fiction',11,'Ireland - USA','THE GAME CHANGER once again features criminal psychologist Dr Kate Pearson, who faces the biggest investigation of her career...\r\n\r\nThis is a story of ordinary people drawn into an extraordinary cult with fatal consequences and a fallout that no one sees coming',1516,'2015-08-03 19:37:04','2015-09-03','1516.jpg','1444789406','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Game-Changer-Louise-Phillips/dp/1444789406',0,1,0,0,432,'9781444789409','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Up the Republic!: Towards a New Ireland ','Fintan O\'Toole','','Faber & Faber','http://www.faber.co.uk/','Politics',24,'Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick','In this important book, historians, lawyers, economists and writers come together to put a coherent case: that although the Irish economic collapse has resulted in national humiliation, renewed emigration and a decline in living standards for the majority of the population, there is still hope that the country can be reformed and renewed.\r\n\r\nIrish politicians offered the now notorious blanket guarantee to all the banks which had got in over their heads during the great property bubble - including one that had become little more than a criminal enterprise.

It empirically maps the decline in standards since the inauguration of Irish independence in 1922, to the loss of Irish economic sovereignty in 2010. This volume offers important perspectives on corruption theory. It argues that the definition of corruption is an evolving one. As the nature of the state changes, so too does the type of corruption. An incremental legal revolution, which emphasised individual rights instead of moral responsibilities, has occurred. The Irish party system, political culture and media influenced the character of Irish corruption. New evidence is presented on the early institutional development of the state. Irish public life was motivated by an ethos which rejected patronage and which sought to build a political framework on ethical foundations. Original archival research provides fresh insights into how the policies of economic protectionalism and discretionary decision making ultimately led to eight official Tribunal inquires into scandal. The emergence of state capture within political decision making is examined by analysing political favouritism towards the beef industry. Unorthodox links between political donations and business or personal interests was the principal cause of scandal. The degree to which this impacted on policy choices which exacerbated the depth of Ireland\'s economic collapse and necessitated intervention by the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in 2010 is considered. This book will appeal to students and scholars of Irish politics, corruption theory, governance, public policy and political financing.',1520,'2015-08-05 06:45:45','2015-08-05','1520.jpg',' 0719086884','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0719086884/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i9?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=desktop-2&pf_rd_r=01Z35Q92AZJ8RMSMQQ0C&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=577048407&pf_rd_i=desktop',0,1,0,0,224,'978-0719086885','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Destinations: Stories from the DART',' Sheila O\'Flanagan','','Headline Lir','','Fiction',11,'Dublin, Landsdowne Road, Sydney Parade, Booterstown, Blackrock, Tara Street, Bayside, Sutton, Howth','Destinations reveals the inside track on the lives of ordinary commuters, and uncovers the hidden links that lie beneath the surface of \'anonymous\' city lives.\r\n\r\nTwo eavesdropping passengers learn more than they bargained for; an office-party fling has unforeseen consequences; a suburban housewife is forced to face her estranged mother - and her thorny past; an office worker finds her commute to work livened up by the daily sightings of a handsome stranger; a hot date with the office stud gets off to a disastrous start ... is there light at the end of the tunnel?\r\n\r\nDestinations - tales that go the distance with you, from one of Ireland\'s best-loved storytellers.',1521,'2015-08-06 09:02:05','2003-07-03','1521.jpg','0755309030','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Destinations-Stories-DART-Sheila-OFlanagan/dp/0755309030/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1438851250&sr=1-2-fkmr0&keywords=dublin+off+the+dart',0,1,0,0,352,'978-0755309030','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('A Long Way from Tipperary: One family\'s journey through famine and war','Ralph  Murphy','','CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform','https://www.createspace.com/','Biography',6,'Gortnahoe, Tippeary, Nenagh, Ypres, Loos, Belgium, Bristol','This is the story of William Murphy and his ancestors who escaped from the Great Famine in Ireland in 1845 to work in the coalmines of South Wales.

But he\'s pushing fifty, feels like a hundred, and things have not been going so well lately. Having recognized the \"man-killing crevasse\" that exists between what he sees and any representation he might make of it--any attempt to make what he sees his own--he\'s stopped painting. And his last purloined possession--aquired the last time he felt the \"secret shiver of bliss\" in thievery--has been discovered. The fact that it was the wife of the man who was, perhaps, his best friend, has compelled him to run away: from his mistress, his home, his wife, from whatever remains of his impulse to paint and from the tragedy that haunts him, and to sequester himself in the house where he was born, trying to uncover in himself the answer to how and why things have turned out as they did. Excavating memories of family, of places he\'s called home, and of the way he has apprehended the world around him (\"no matter what else is going on, one of my eyes is always swivelling towards the world beyond\"), Ollie reveals the very essence of a man who, in some way, has always been waiting to be rescued from himself.

Often working undercover and involved in all kinds of ‘dirty tricks’, he narrowly misses capture and death at the hands of his enemies. David’s life is complicated by his falling for a beautiful republican girl who is on the fringes of the IRA and is eventually driven out of Ulster by her Special Branch tormentors. The task though was “The collection, collation and dissemination of intelligence.” To this end David did everything from reading the newspapers to covertly photographing terrorist suspects, from interrogation and surveillance, to dirty tricks. Anything short of open criminality was acceptable. The fact that even his superiors often had little idea exactly what his role was, added to a feeling of freedom of action. A vivid description of the border war raged by the IRA, against the towns and villages of Counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, in the early seventies. It is a true story taken from the author’s firsthand experience with historically valuable photographic evidence. An unlikely and dangerous love story which took place during a major conflict, fought on our very own doorstep that to a great extent was won by intelligence and covert actions. As well as being a recognition of unsung heroes, with their stories put in the public domain for the first time, this book takes a close look at the political machinations and secret double dealings that the government of the Irish Republic engaged in at that time.',1537,'2015-08-11 06:25:04','2015-08-11','1537.jpg','150765992X','','','Amazon.co.uk','http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Soldiers-Ulster-David-McEvoy/dp/150765992X/ref=sr_1_58?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1439273873&sr=1-58&keywords=fermanagh',0,1,0,0,378,'978-1507659922','','English',1,0.0000,'0',''),('Ireland\'s Birds','Niall  Mac Coitir, Gordon  D\'Arcy','','The Collins Press','http://www.collinspress.ie/','Non-fiction',19,'Ireland','Birds have been important symbols in our art and culture for thousands of years.

An elusive figure, her interior world has never before been observed as closely as in this ground-breaking study of her work, philosophy and inner circle of fellow artists. Jennifer Goff expertly blends art history and biography to create a stunning ensemble, offering a clear beacon of light into truly understanding Gray - the woman and the professional. Gray was a self-taught polymath and her work was multi-functional, user-friendly, ready for mass production yet succinctly unique, and her designs show great technical virtuosity. Her expertise in lacquer work and carpet design, often overlooked, is given due attention in this book, as is her fascinating relationship with the architect Le Corbusier and many other compelling and complex relationships. The book also offers rare insights into Gray s early years as an artist.

O’Dwyer has walked – or, in the case of Clonmacnoise, cycled – the pilgrim trails of Ireland, from Slieve Mish in the northeast, where Christianity may have had its first dawning in Ireland, to Skellig Michael in the southwest, where the known world once ended.

He recounts his personal and professional relationships with such luminaries as Patrick Kavanagh, Allen Ginsberg and, as co-founder of Claddagh Records, with composer Seán Ó Riada. There is an interesting account of meeting Charles Haughey and a suggestion that a seed was sown that might have led ultimately to the introduction of the artist tax exemption. \r\n\r\nThe Pear is Ripe covers a period of great social change and upheaval internationally and, in particular, the north of Ireland. Montague\'s proximity to these changes, by accident or design, was to influence his work and lends this memoir an immediacy that belies the intervening years. \r\n\r\nWhile much of the book covers the writer\'s public and literary life, it also addresses the strain that living apart from his wife Madeleine placed on their marriage -- which would ultimately lead to their break-up. While the book principally spans the period from the mid-sixties to the late seventies, Montague has included a powerful and moving epilogue featuring more recent events. He writes of visiting young men with AIDS in a New York hospital, and of a final meeting with an ailing Samuel Beckett in Paris. \r\n\r\nPoetry Ireland director Joe Woods has spoken of the dearth of memoir by poets that may help to inform their work and its enjoyment. John Montague\'s book and its earlier companion Company: A Chosen Life hopefully will set a trend for some of the other workers in song to follow suit. In short, The Pear Is Ripe is a startling testimony from an engaging writer at the peak of his powers.

As Caroline was unable to carry a baby to full term, the pair unsuccessfully explored IVF treatment and adoption, before finding a glimmer of hope through Dr Patel’s Infertility Clinic in India. To great celebration, they met the surrogate mother in August 2010 and following a successful embryo transfer, Ava was born in April 2011. However, when their heartache should have turned to joy, they met another battle… \r\nOn the basis that Ava was a surrogacy baby, the Irish Government refused to issue her a passport or emergency travel documents. The deficit of legislation governing surrogacy in Ireland, combined with the surrogate mother being considered the legal mother, left Caroline and Ava stranded in India in a legal limbo, with terrorism threats ripe in the wake of bin Laden’s death.\r\n\r\nThe issuing of Ava’s passport ultimately affected the status of surrogacy in Ireland: in February 2012, new guidelines were used by the Department of Justice to assist parents planning to have children via surrogate mothers abroad that allowed for the granting of travel documents. Caroline and Niall’s tale of surrogacy is brave and bitter-sweet, embracing the richness and diversity of Indian culture and the generosity of its people.

The area in which these disappearances occurred became publicly referred to as ‘The Vanishing Triangle\'. To date, none of the missing females have ever been located.\r\n\r\nThese six unsolved cases resulted in the creation of the specialist Garda task force \'Operation Trace\', set up in the hope of finding a connection between the missing women. None was found. The task force investigated dozens of other unsolved cases of women gone missing in Ireland. Alan Bailey served as the National Coordinator for the task force for thirteen years, and the revealing stories in Missing, Presumed all come from his personal experiences in this role.\r\n\r\nMissing, Presumed details, and reports on, the Garda investigations into the case studies of fifteen women who disappeared over a time span of twenty years. In almost half of the cases, the women\'s badly mutilated bodies were recovered, sometimes months later, buried in shallow graves. Each chapter focuses on one woman’s story, and details the timeline of events that led to her disappearance, beginning on the day of her disappearance through to the ensuing investigation, and up to – when lucky – a conviction. These stories are harrowing, terrifying, and true.\r\n\r\n',1706,'2015-08-31 11:36:50','2015-08-31','1706.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/missing-presumed',0,0,0,0,0,'9781909718852','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('A Restless Life','Leland Bardwell','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com','Non-fiction',19,'Ireland, Dublin','This no-holds-barred account of Leland Bardwell’s life spans five decades and unveils the shroud of innocence that often clouds our vision of the past. Bardwell confronts her life head on, confessing bygone sins and exorcising old demons. However, despite the hardships of her life, this is far from a misery memoir, as A Restless Life celebrates the artistic, and often times anarchistic life of one of Ireland’s hidden, literary treasures.\r\n\r\nA young girl returns with her family from India to live in Leixlip, Co Kildare. For Leland Bardwell, like so many of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, the realities of life in the big house were far more modest and threadbare than appearances portrayed. A distant father and a temperamental mother left the awkward Leland to herself, and she spent much of her childhood disappearing into the countryside, smoking Afton cigarettes with pennies cadged from her father’s pockets. This itinerant and isolated existence becomes the template for much of her later life.\r\n\r\nLeland falls madly in love with her father’s cousin, a life-long obsession which derails her quiet solitude. An unplanned pregnancy brings her to a war-torn London, where her son is adopted. Accumulating lovers and children over the years she becomes a teacher in the highlands of Scotland, and a paper-seller on the street corners of Paris, before returning to Dublin. Here, she struggles to combine motherhood with artistic expression, as well as juggle her various affairs (both official and illicit).\r\n\r\nOstracised by her family, her tiny flat on Leeson Street becomes a refuge for writers, artists, eccentrics, and the drunken literary crew of McDaid’s pub. It is in this melee that she first beds and then befriends Patrick Kavanagh, in what is a humorous and affectionate portrait of one of Ireland’s best-loved poets. The heartbreak, mayhem, and comedy of those years is told with a raw but poetic honesty that justifies the Irish Times naming her “the doyenne of women poets writing in',1707,'2015-08-31 11:41:48','2015-08-31','1707.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/a-restless-life',0,0,0,0,0,'9781905483464','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('Where the Streets Have 2 Names','Patrick Brocklebank','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com','Music',18,'Ireland, Dublin','Where the Streets Have 2 Names features hundreds of previously unpublished photographs by award-winning photographer Patrick Brocklebank, documenting U2’s early days as well as the rise of other groups who were part of Dublin\'s music scene at that time, such as: the Virgin Prunes, The Blades, The Black Catholics, The Undertones and The Buzzcocks.\r\n\r\nThe photos capture iconic moments in the lives of these bands, particularly U2, and are accompanied by numerous untold anecdotes about the band members and the long-gone music venues of that era, where many of the bands’ most seminal gigs were performed.

Boasting ballroom and function facilities in the heart of Dublin city, two golf courses, superb playing fields for GAA, rugby and soccer, an ultramodern sports and leisure centre, and a clubhouse with fine banqueting and conference facilities, the club is second to none.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary history of the Dublin Metropolitan Garda Recreation Club is unfolded in this book as a testament to the vision, industry and sheer grit and determination of its founding members and those charged with carrying on its legacy. Arising from the remnants of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin Metropolitan police, the embryonic club existed for forty years before being radically reconstituted in 1961. This was largely through the efforts of one man, Edmund (Ned) Garvey.\r\n\r\nFrom its Harrington Street premises, the Garda Club emerged as one of the top entertainment hotspots in Dublin in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The revenue generated from bingo, cabaret, Big Band dancing and disco, along with members\' subscriptions, made it possible for the club to embark on ambitious development plans. This culminated in the purchase of land in 1975 near Rathfarnham that would become Stackstown Golf Club. In time this club was open to civilian membership and spawned the Irish golfing legend Padraig Harrington.\r\n\r\nAdditional lands purchased in the mid and late-1980s in Westmanstown, Clonsilla gave rise to the jewel in the crown - the Westmanstown Sports and Conference Centre. From such prized premises, the club provided training facilities not only for Garda and civilian members but Irish athletes preparing for the Special Olympics in 2003 and international teams such as the All-Blacks in 2008.\r\n',1709,'2015-08-31 11:51:23','2015-08-31','1709.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/the-garda-club-a-history-of-dublin-metropolitan-garda-recreation-club',0,0,0,0,0,'9780956571304','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('Setting the Truth Free','Julieann Campbell','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com','Non-fiction',19,'Ireland, North Ireland, Derry, Great Britain','An intelligent and emotive inside account of the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign, which records the personal stories of the campaigners, the relatives and the wounded themselves right up to the Saville Report’s publication in June 2010.

Many books have been written on the subject but few mention in significant detail how these ordinary people achieved the impossible and unwittingly made history.

What strikes the reader most strongly is the unselfconscious heroism of those who took part in the Rising.\r\n\r\nThis edition features an updated foreword by the late Garret FitzGerald and correspondence between George Bernard Shaw and Desmond\'s wife Mabel, the republican daughter of a Presbyterian Belfast businessman.

Just Garret is the personal account of the public and private lives of a man who led his country through a hugely turbulent period of history – always with intelligence and finesse. FitzGerald reflects candidly on his hugely varied career: his central role in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Ireland’s place in the EU on the global stage, and the threat posed to the state by IRA atrocities. He writes of the lighter moments of his professional life – including the discovery of spies in the Stillorgan Shopping Centre.    \r\n\r\nEven after such a full political life, FitzGerald remained fully engaged with Irish society and politics, bringing his characteristic steady hand and razor-sharp insight to the issues of the day in his weekly Irish Times column and elsewhere.

It was the main topic of conversation in pubs, homes and workplaces as newspapers daily carried new and salacious details of the \"Black Widow\'s\" scheming, as well as images of her glamorous and expansive wardrobe, on their front pages. In the days before murders became a daily occurrence in Ireland, the allegations of contract killers, extra-marital affairs, fraud and involvement with Republican organisations seemed better suited to the big screen than a small town pub. \r\n\r\nPat Flynn led the investigation against Catherine, a woman whom he had encountered several times before these events unfolded. He had witnessed her fabricate accusations of sexual abuse against his Garda colleagues while she continued to enthral his superior officers and Judge O\'Buachalla. He describes how holes in her version of the events on the night of the murder were found, along with evidence of how she had been plotting for years to have her husband murdered. \r\n\r\nFlynn also reported Judge O\'Buachalla for granting Catherine the license for the pub solely in her name through irregular channels, after she had been charged with murder and as rumours of an affair between them had become rife. \r\n\r\nAlthough O\'Buachalla was discussed in the Dáil and a judicial investigation ordered, the results were never publicised, despite promises to the contrary from the then Minister for Justice, and the judge continued to sit in court.

Unlike most people, though, he left his home behind to make a bolt for those distant worlds and daring adventures. \r\n\r\nAfter one failed attempt to run away to join the British army, his second attempt succeeded, with him stowing away on the mail boat to Britain. Lying about his age, he was accepted into the army and, following his training, was posted to the strategically important island of Malta. The initial pleasures of the Mediterranean island and its beaches and entertainment areas gave way to the reality of unprecedentedly heavy air raids. \r\n\r\nHarte would later be transferred to Palestine, where he and his comrades were involved in several clandestine raids. Such activities ultimately saw Harte being selected for the elite Special Boat Service -- the forerunner of the SAS. Harte was captured, and many of his memoir\'s most amusing - and occasionally disturbing - episodes cover his internment as a prisoner of war in a German POW camp. \r\n\r\nPart coming-of-age memoir and part war story, Harte\'s remarkable, often funny tale reads like a novel and serves to remind us of the vital role played by Irish men and women in the Second World War. Limits of Endurance is a testament to the immutability of one man\'s spirit against extraordinary circumstance. Also included are previously unpublished photographs of the era.

It was the governing body for soccer for the whole of the island of Ireland. Soccer in Ireland was united for over forty years. It was, though, an uneasy alliance. Many in the south believed that the governing body was heavily biased towards Ulster. Most internationals were played in Belfast, most players selected were from the North-East. With the country moving politically towards partition, soccer in Ireland was arguably affected more by the political environment than any other sport. As tensions rose between unionist and nationalist communities, soccer, with strong support bases in both communities, became embroiled in the conflict, playing host to many ugly sectarian incidents.Divisions in the sport reached a climax after the First World War, culminating in the split of 1921 when Leinster seceded from the IFA and formed the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).Making use of extensive primary sources from the IFA, FAI, the English FA and the Leinster Football Association as well as contemporary newspaper sources, The Irish Soccer Split details the events and causes that led to the split in soccer in Ireland.It compares soccer to other sports that remained or became united after partition. The Irish Soccer Split recounts the early years of the FAI and its attempts to gain international recognition. Many efforts were made to heal the division throughout the 1920s and the early 1930s. Efforts were renewed during the Troubles in the 1970s and 1980s to bring about an all-Ireland international team.

Extending a one-year working holiday visa into thirty months, Paul lived the colourful, precarious and occasionally solitary life of a ‘backpacker’ in various locations throughout Australia, travelling extensively through every State and Territory in Australia including a trip across the Bass Straits to Tasmania. In this and two other journeys across the continent, he travelled (and slept) in Bertha, encountering many fascinating characters (including the Queensland drug dealer-turned-miner who had blown off all his fingers in repeated work accidents; the Adelaide Aborigine whose Irish uncle, in revenge for Captain Cook, claimed the territory of Britain for Australia from the top of Big Ben; the ex-alcoholic in Tasmania who relayed that his bi-polar condition could be traced back to his direct ancestor, King George III; the dying man in the Kimberleys who had witnessed a haunting aboriginal dance gathering in 1925....) and much of Australia’s hidden history and landscape. \r\n\r\nTravels With Bertha is the perfect book for not only those planning on or dreaming about visiting Australia, but also those who have returned and want to relive their years Down Under.

His election win in November 2008 was a moment of enormous historical magnitude, greeted with an outpouring of emotion in the US and around the world. However, on taking office, Obama was faced with unparalleled challenges as the global economy plunged ever-deeper into crisis and the US struggled with the two wars in which it was enmeshed. \r\n\r\nIn Redemption Song, Niall Stanage tells the extraordinary tale of Obama\'s journey from community organiser in Chicago to leader of the free world through exclusive interviews with some of the new president\'s oldest friends and closest advisors. He explores the then-senator\'s long and acrimonious tussle with Hillary Clinton, sheds new light on his battle with John McCain and running mate Sarah Palin, and hears from the members of the grassroots movement that carried Obama all the way to the Oval Office. \r\n\r\nHe also provides an intimate account of the first phase of the Obama presidency, reporting from within the White House walls on the new Administration\'s first tests, triumphs and tribulations.',1762,'2015-09-01 11:05:36','2015-09-01','1762.jpg','','','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com/shop/redemption-song',0,0,0,0,0,'9781905483570','','English',61,0.0000,'0',''),('When We Dance','Melanie Verwoerd','','Liberties Press','http://www.libertiespress.com','Non-fiction',19,'South Africa, apartheid, RTE, Gerry Ryan, UNICEF','When We Dance is a fascinating account of the life of a woman who played a major role in South Africa’s journey from apartheid to democracy, and went on to become South African ambassador to Ireland.

Memorialised in drama, poetry and fiction as \'Shane the Proud\', he has been remarkably neglected by historians who have been content - or resigned - to accept the largely personalised accounts of his character and actions, broadcast by his enemies, as a fair estimation of his historical significance. In this extended and critical study of Shane\'s life and times, Ciaran Brady, leading historian in Early Modern History, returns this neglected and misunderstood historical figure to his rightful place - at the centre of this turbulent period in Irish history. Based on a detailed examination of all the available primary sources, and also on a critical examination of the stories and myths that came to surround Shane, Brady offers an original interpretation that sets Shane against the multi-layered backgrounds of Ulster, Irish and English Court politics of his time - moving away from the conventional cultural stereotypes through which Shane and his contemporaries have been customarily interpreted.\nIn doing so Brady reveals not only the highly complex nature of the problems confronting Shane and his English adversaries, and the genuine nature of the attempts of both sides to find a permanent solution on mutually acceptable terms, but also the combination of surface contingencies and deeper ideological forces that doomed their efforts to failure.<br>Foreword; Preface; Chronology of O\'Neill\'s Life and Times; Chapter One: The Legend of Shane the Proud: A Myth and Its Uses; Chapter Two: The Problems of O\'Neill Lordship, 124',7854,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2015-10-08','9781910820056.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,128,'9781910820056',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Years of Turbulence: The Irish Revolution and Its Aftermath\'','','','University College Dublin Press','','Humanities',41,'British & Irish history; 20th century history: c 1900  to c 2000; Revolutions, uprisings, rebellions','\'Years of Turbulence showcases many new perspectives on the Irish revolutionary period of 1912-23.

The contributors to this fascinating collection not only focus on new angles, they also revisit traditional assumptions, and elaborate on some of the central, current debates on the revolutionary period. Many muted voices of the revolution are given a platform for the first time in these pages. The  collection demonstrates a determination to uncover personal experiences and protests that until now have remained relatively undocumented and ignored. Such themes as the experience of violence in its various forms, the specific circumstances of individual counties, tensions between constitutionalism and radicalism, between elites and the grassroots, the extent to which the IRA\'s campaign was effectively co-ordinated and controlled, as well as the challenge of writing about women and what they experienced, are deeply considered.\nHistorians in this collection also recognise the need to address, not just events of the revolutionary period, but its afterlife, assessing what the revolution and its leaders came to symbolise, the extent to which a hierarchy of benefit existed in its aftermath, and what the implications were for survivors. Making use of a variety of recently released archival material - including censuses of Ireland of 1901 and 1911, the Bureau of Military History collection, the Military Archives and Service Pensions Collection - Years of Turbulence reveals a fascinating web of different experiences during the revolutionary era',7855,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2015-11-01','9781910820070.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,300,'9781910820070',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Sisters and Lies\'','','','Penguin Books Ltd','http://www.penguin.com','Fiction',11,'Modern & contemporary fiction; General & Literary Fiction; AF:General; AF: General; ','\'One hot August night, Rachel Darcy gets the call everyone fears.

With contributions from families who have benefited from the care received from the hospice, this book is ultimately one about hope and courage.<br>Laura and Lynn\'s Story recounts the heartbreaking tale of the McKenna family, who lost both daughters to illness 20 months apart. Laura, aged four, died very quickly and peacefully after the final surgery to repair a hole in her heart, having previously spent seven months of the first year of life in Our Lady\'s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and gone through three previous surgeries.  On the day of Laura\'s surgery, Lynn, aged 13 at the time and never sick in her life, was diagnosed with leukemia. Laura died the following day, never having woken up, and Lynn was already a patient in Oncology at Our Lady\'s Hospital. After eight months of chemo and other aggressive treatments, she was in remission for about five months before she re-relapsed. While waiting for a bone marrow transplant her condition worsened, and there was nothing else that could be done.  In her last week Lynn wrote letters to all who had been so wonderful to her, including her doctors; saw friends; said her \"goodbyes\"; arranged her funeral and wrote her will. When she was too weak to write, Jane did it for her, but she dictated.How she coped with her illness, her adored sister\'s sad death and her own imminent demise is an inspiration to us - she wished it could be different, but accepted it with such dignity, aged just 15.\nShe lived every minute of her last weeks to the full, which is how we should all live our lives.

It offers twelve stepping stones to help anyone navigate through difficult times, especially when life doesn\'t go according to plan, or when it changes dramatically due to a life-changing event.  The book is inspired by the author\'s autistic son, Cian. Cian is mostly non-verbal. Words do not come easy for him, but when he speaks his words have proved to be meaningful and often profound. The author shares her son\'s wisdom with the reader and demonstrates how his insight has taught her how to live a life of her own against the odds. Each of the twelve chapters contains a stepping stone inspired by Cian\'s simple words and messages: 1.	\"All broken\"- examines brokenness and the road to acceptance so healing can begin. 2.	\"Sad\" - gives the reader permission to grieve. 3.	\"Shush!\"- explores the gift of silence in a fast paced world.  4.	\"Sor-ree\" - gently encourages the reader to heal the hurting heart.  5.	\"Never mind\"- empowers the reader to let go and mind less by living in the present. 6.	\"All done now\" - prepares the reader for a new beginning.  7.\"\nPress the button!\" - brings the reader back to their passions and back to themselves. 8.	\"Feck\'s sake, Jeo quist!\" - is a little reminder that Rome wasn\'t built in a day.  9.	\"Giggles\" - instills fun and laughter along every step of the journey back.  10.	\"Duh worree\" - demonstrates how the reader must ignore the crazy fears and do it anyway. 11.	\"I lu vu\" - reflects on the power of love of loving ourselves and others.  12.	\"Chocit Cake?\" - A stepping stone to celebrating life just as it is.<br>Originally from County Tyrone, Aileen McGee is a mother of three and lives in County Donegal.

But when Ireland\'s War of Independence descends into Civil War he lays down his gun forever.<br>It\'s April, 1916. Dublin GAA footballer Frank Shouldice has just won the Croke Cup. It\'s a big achievement for the up and coming star, but he has other things on his mind. Two weeks after the final whistle he\'s on a rooftop in North King Street with a rifle in his hand. His cheekbone is grazed by a bullet smashing into the wall behind him and, according to a confidential military file, Frank Shouldice is killed in action.  Except he\'s very much alive. His brother Jack commands the barricaded street below. In some of the heaviest fighting of the Easter Rising the South Staffordshire Regiment can\'t budge a pocket of Irish Volunteers defiantly holding out. Desperate to get the upper hand, the South Staffs storm the barricades after dawn. Through the sights of a borrowed pair of binoculars Frank takes aim from the Jameson malthouse high above. The street is soon littered with casualties and the British troops are forced to withdraw.  Pearse\'s surrender begins the next chapter of this extraordinary story. In the eventful years that follow, Frank, formerly a civil servant at the Land Commission, will spend jail terms in Stafford, Brixton and Wormwood Scrubs.When he gets home to Ballaghadereen, County Roscommon he is placed under close surveillance by MI5, the military and police in Ireland.\nHe is court-martialled in Frongoch internment camp when as Hut Leader he protects other prisoners from conscription. Incarcerated at Usk Prison in Wales he leads a daring four-man escape to freedom.  But he didn\'t like to talk about it.

One of Ireland\'s leading literary critics, Pine asks, What links Ireland and Greece? The author\'s trenchant, provocative arguments acknowledge both the strengths and the weaknesses of Greece today, and draw suggestive parallels with the Irish situation. In particular, Greece through Irish Eyes examines the shared history of Ireland and Greece *	in wars of independence and civil wars *	in the pandemic of clientelism *	in the Church/State nexus *	in the power of political dynasties *	in economic crises.  Pine pays special attention to the family values of honour, loyalty, and economy, arguing that these are at the heart of Greek society and culture. He develops this in a comprehensive survey of Greek law, literature and politics, and Greece\'s position at the centre of Balkan affairs. He graphically describes the effects of austerity on society and the economy, with up-to-the-minute accounts of the new government\'s attempts to renegotiate Greece\'s bailout.He strongly criticises the intransigence of bureaucracy, the pervasiveness of bribery and corruption and the continuing threats of terrorism and fascism.\nRichard Pine also calls for a major rethink on Greek and Irish positions on Europe. The parallels between Ireland and Greece may make some readers uncomfortable, but they are substantiated by solid examples of cultural, economic and historical differences which argue against integration into a centre-dominated Europe.  \"Greece is a country I both love and mourn.

Currently these areas are disconnected elements of a system of care, whereas in an integrated system they would be fully connected. The book is focused on the situation in Ireland but offers international relevance. An ecological perspective, with recognition of the importance of both the child and the worker as dyadic elements within this system, is the focus throughout. The child\'s perspective is presented through a biographical narrative of a former child in care and with case studies from the author\'s practice experience. The workers\' perspective is addressed through detailed critical analysis of the elements which constitute the profession of social care, which include practice, theory, approaches to care, policy, rights, research, legislation, social justice, professionalisation, privatisation and the socio-political and socio-economic factors which impact on the profession of social care, and therefore children in care.Through this analysis a nuanced and informed perspective, identifying both strengths and weaknesses, is offered on the care system in Ireland in 2015.\nThe book identifies significant deficiencies in the current aftercare services available in Ireland, and advocates for a statutory entitlement to aftercare support for all care leavers.

Based on newly uncovered and extensive police records, FBI files, and archives of the Communist International in Moscow, O\'Connor goes beyond the public figure of heroism to explore the hidden side of a very private person who hated people knowing his business and kept his ambitions and personal demons behind a veil of silence. \'Big Jim\' remains the central figure in the history, public history, and mythology of Irish Labour. A powerful orator and brilliant agitator, in popular consciousness Larkin is forever linked with the 1913 Lockout and the formation of the modern Irish Labour movement. Since 1909 he has been the hero of the Irish Transport and General Workers\' Union, the Workers\' Union of Ireland, and SIPTU.

As with so many of his political generation, Aiken\'s path to politics began amid the violent upheaval of the Irish revolution. In a career spanning 50 years he served in numerous high-profile ministerial roles and earned widespread recognition for his work as Ireland\'s representative to the United Nations. Yet these later successes masked a controversial past. This comprehensive study provides the first in-depth look at Aiken\'s role in Ireland\'s turbulent revolutionary period, 1916-23. Drawing on a wide variety of original archival sources, this book blends elements of biography and local study to offer both the first exhaustive account of Aiken\'s role in the conflict, and the first in-depth study of the broader context of republican politics and violence in Ulster in which he played such a pivotal role.

It begins on 21 January 1919 with the opening of the First Dail (parliament) in Dublin and the publication of the Irish Declaration of Independence. It closes on 6 December 1922, the date of the founding of the Irish Free State, one year after the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed. The intervening years covered in this volume were turbulent: a bitter political and military clash in Ireland, the British partition of the island into Northern and Southern Ireland in 1920, a negotiated settlement giving Southern Ireland dominion status through the December 1921 Treaty, and the emergence of the Irish Free State amid the violence of a civil war which began in June 1922 and ended in May 1923. These years also saw the birth, near death and re-birth of the Irish Department of External (now Foreign) Affairs, where these foundational documents were written into history.\nThe volume includes previously unseen letters from Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith, Eamon de Valera; confidential despatches and political reports from Irish diplomats, including accounts of the fundraising activities of Eamon de Valera and Harry Boland in America.

This title novella and four short stories comprise her second book.<br>The title novella and four short stories in Molly McCloskey\'s dazzling second book vary in setting, tone and characterization, but their subject, always, is love. McCloskey writes of broken families, misbegotten relationships, the mysterious communion of brothers and sisters, and the invincible love of a father and daughter, in a voice at once witty, warm and sharp. Her characters are lonely when together, and pulled by the unfathomable imperatives of the heart when alone. From the dual quest narrative of \'The Beautiful Changes\' - a daughter\'s quest for a lost father, and the father\'s quest for sobriety - to the funny and moving tales of family life and sexual misadventure in the shorter stories, Molly McCloskey shows herself to be a philosopher of tears, and a storyteller of the first rank.<br>\'The stories build their memorable world cumulatively, piece by brittle, affecting piece.\' - Sylvia Brownrigg, The Times \'A poised, fluid and darkly memorable voice...

This book offers an insight into the life and career of one of our most gifted singers.<br>For the last thirty years, singer Mary Black has been a dominant presence on the Irish music scene, an award-winning artist with many bestselling albums to her name. Now, in this long-awaited memoir, Mary takes us back to the roots of her musical heritage and to the influences that helped to shape her as an artist and a woman. Born into a musical family, Mary Black - a feisty tomboy who could hold her own when it came to sparring with her brothers and anyone else brave enough to take her on - began singing folk songs from the age of ten. Music played an important role in the family home and, performing with her brothers and her sister Frances, Mary built her highly successful career on the bedrock of these early years. From the pubs and clubs of her hometown, Dublin, she went on to perform in some of the most prestigious venues across the world. Always committed to exploring new material from the best writers, her unique talent attracted acclaim from critics, fellow artists and the public alike. It also led to a host of bestselling albums, including the multi-platinum No Frontiers, which spent more than a year in the Irish Top 30.\nMary\'s love of singing was matched only by the love she had for her family. As she recalls the inevitable tensions that arose when trying to juggle family life and a high-profile career, she tells of her struggle to combine the two contrasting aspects of her life. It was only through gritty determination, hard work and a fair amount of laughter that Mary was able to enjoy major success as an artist and, at the same time, raise a close and loving family with her husband Joe.

Four thousand sites including churches, tower houses, ball alleys, granaries, bacon manufactories and department stores are recorded in the extensive topographical section capturing Limerick\'s Viking foundations in the early ninth century, through the Anglo-Norman, medieval, early modern and modern periods. The introductory historical essay is illustrated with text maps of the Viking settlements and a conjectural early street, as well as a map of medieval Limerick that chronicles the line of the city walls and buildings. Vignettes of Limerick\'s urban history are dotted throughout the text section. Limerick\'s prominence as a southern Irish port city means it has been densely mapped since the late sixteenth century. Assembled here are reconstructed Ordnance Survey plans from 1840, some 27 loose-sheet historical facsimiles, including Elizabethan maps from 1587 to 1590; John Speed\'s 1610 map; the Pacata Hibernia from 1633; Webb\'s 1651 map and various others.

There are so many different versions of the story of Easter Week 1916.

It details the women who came out to fight and profiles the sixteen executed leaders, as well as looking at the rebellion outside of Dublin.

Ned\'s father, Edward, an ardent Fenian, died before his son was born, but Ned\'s Uncle John, also a radical Fenian, was a formative influence. John Daly was prepared to use physical force to win Ireland\'s freedom and was imprisoned for twelve years for his activities.

Yet young Ned was seen as frivolous and unmotivated, interested only in his appearance and his social life.

He had produced warm, witty and insightful material that made it clear that he was a wonderful writer as well as a great singer and storyteller. With the encouragement of his wife Deirdre and his family, he continued to think about the book and conducted a number of interviews to keep things ticking over until he was well enough to resume work on it. But sadly, much as he wanted to, Ronnie did not get to finish his story. However, with the whole-hearted co-operation of his daughter and son, Cliodhna and Phelim, it has been possible to put together Ronnie\'s work on his memoir along with his other writings, interviews with Cliodhna and Phelim, a wealth of photographs and other material from the family archive, and contributions from close friends, to create a book that is a wonderful portrait of, and a fitting and loving tribute to, the man Bono called \'the king of Ireland\'.<br>Ronnie Drew was born in Glasthule, Co Dublin in 1934. Until his late twenties he worked - unhappily and often badly - in various jobs: apprentice electrician, trainee draper\'s assistant, salesman, telephonist, language teacher. In 1962 his casual singing sessions with Barney McKenna, Luke Kelly and Ciaran Bourke evolved into something regular and the men started performing together as the group that became the Dubliners. It was a seismic moment in Irish cultural history. The Dubliners combined brilliance, danger and a raucous earthiness, and they broke down the barriers between popular and traditional music. The group was, and remains, a source of inspiration to artists such as U2 and Shane MacGowan. And at its heart always - even after he had left it - was Ronnie Drew. In the mid-1990s Ronnie developed a solo career that saw him combine his two passions, singing and story-telling, and explore his interests in a range of other artistic activities - everything from acting to jazz s',7782,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2008-11-26','9781844881987.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,274,'9781844881987',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'The Booles and the Hintons: Two Dynasties That Helped Shape the Modern World\'','','','Cork University Press','','Biography',6,'Philosophy of mathematics; Revolutionary groups & movements; Travel writing; United Kingdom, Great B','\'Gerry Kennedy set off on a tour through Russia, China, Japan and the USA .

Only dimly aware of his Victorian ancestors: George Boole, forefather of the digital revolution and James Hinton, eccentric philosopher and advocate of polygamy, he had directly followed in the footsteps of two dynasties of radical thinkers and doers.Their notable achievements, in which the women were particularly prominent, involved many spheres. Boole\'s wife, Mary Everest, niece of George Everest, surveyor of the eponymous mountain, was an early advocate of hands-on education. Of the five talented Boole daughters, Ethel Voynich, wife of the discoverer of the enigmatic, still unexplained Voynich Manuscript, campaigned with Russian anarchists to overthrow the Tsar. Her 1897 novel The Gadfly, filmed later with music by Shostakovich, sold in millions behind the Iron Curtain. She was rumoured to have had an affair with the notorious \'Ace of Spies\', Sidney Reilly. One of Ethel\'s sisters married Charles Howard Hinton: a leading exponent of the esoteric realm of the fourth dimension and inventor of the gunpowder baseball-pitcher.\nOf their descendants, Carmelita Hinton also pioneered progressive education in the USA at her school in Putney, Vermont. Her children dedicated their lives to Mao\'s China. Appalled by the dropping on Japan of the atomic bomb that she had helped design, Joan Hinton defected to China and actively engaged in the Cultural Revolution.

From Maria Edgeworth\'s satire to Bernard Shaw\'s subversiveness, from the hauntings of C.R. Maturin\'s Melmoth the Wanderer to those of Oscar Wilde\'s Picture of Dorian Gray, from national tale to novel of ideas, thirty representative works are selected for fluent and accessible discussion. Focusing on the problematic condition of the protagonist, each discussion combines close reading with considerations of such broader thematic and conceptual issues as identities, contexts, genres and language. An insightful introduction underlines these issues\' significance, and a further understanding of that is provided by noting their various iterations over the whole range of novels selected. Discussion of each individual work is prefaced by a biographical and critical overview of its authors. These, together with an extensive bibliography, also make this work a convenient reference tool both for students and general readers.  The work\'s originality and diversity is further enriched by its reconfiguration of the nineteenth-century Irish novel\'s canon.Neglected works are critically assessed, some for the first time.\nFictional views of Ireland by English writers including Thackeray and Trollope is evaluated, a departure which also opens up new lines of inquiry into nineteenth-century Anglo-Irish literary relations. The relevance to Irish literary culture of works with English settings by expatriate Irish writers such as Charlotte Riddell, George Moore, Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker is also critically explored.

Diarmuid O Grada depicts the Georgian city as a place of conflict where sharp divisions arose between the haves and have-nots. His work reveals the causes of this upheaval and its impact on ordinary Dubliners.<br>It is the Georgian heritage that most strongly defines Ireland\'s capital city. However, Diarmuid O Grada now shows us a Dublin quite unlike that depicted in the conventional histories of grand red-brick squares and elegant drawing rooms. Phenomenal population growth was forced on a place where local government, the workshops and the streets themselves had changed little since medieval times. In the course of the century the number of Dubliners trebled and the city was quite unprepared for the urgent challenge of feeding and housing so many people. In addition, Dublin\'s role as the bastion of an English colony was transformed into that of the Irish capital.  This book explains how Dublin\'s adjustment to the new reality gave rise to widespread civil unrest and how the official reaction to the turmoil took on aspects of a crusade. Most of these responses failed and, in reality, there were periods when the city was running out of control. Diarmuid O Grada draws on a wide range of sources, including newspapers and parish records that had previously been neglected. His own career as a town planner has given him an understanding of urban impacts in terms of time and space.Georgian Dublin explains the processes at work and sets them within the wider context, comparing Dublin\'s successes and failures with events in other European cities.<br>Diarmuid O Grada is a planning consultant and occasional lecturer in planning at University College Dublin.<br>\'',7768,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2015-10-01','9781782051473.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,404,'9781782051473',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'A History of the Easter Rising in 50 Objects\'','','','The Mercier Press Ltd','','Humanities',41,'National liberation & independence, post-colonialism; European history; National liberation & indepe','\'For 100 years objects left behind from 1916 have borne silent witness to the events of Easter Week - this book tells their stories and uses them in a unique way to cast light on many of the lesser-known elements of the Rising.<br>In this book John Gibney tells the story of the Rising and its aftermath through 50 objects that survive from that time. Some of these are what you might expect - documents, uniforms, weapons and flags - but others are quirkier objects, like the cricket bat that died for Ireland, Sean Mac Diarmada\'s hurley, the teacups the Pearse brothers used for their last cup of tea with their family, Thomas Kent\'s rosary beads and Kathleen Lynn\'s prison biscuits.

But his drive and determination weren\'t forged in a vacuum: they came from growing up in a family and place where Gaelic football was all that mattered.

Little did he know that in order to do business in the city, senior politicians and public officials would want a slice of the action ...in large amounts of cash. Gilmartin blew the whistle on corruption at the heart of government and the city\'s planning system, and the fallout from his claims ultimately led to the resignation of the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in 2008. The developer, who died in November 2013, was thoroughly vindicated in the final report of the Mahon Tribunal in March 2012.

Ahead of America where Andrew Jackson was creating his own brand of popular politics, O\'Connell brought together rich and poor in support of a new phenomenon that became the popular political party. O\'Connell began the shift in power from landed wealth to democratic nationalism. His success was built upon by Charles Stewart Parnell who created the first truly effective political party in the 1880s. The success of both O\'Connell and Parnell was based on the flow of money into their organisations to sustain their political machines. By following the money trail, Michael Keyes reveals in this ground-breaking book how O\'Connell turned money into political power and how sixty years later Parnell did the same. Until now there has been no serious examination of how early nationalists raised money, how they accounted for it and - occasionally - how they misappropriated it.\nIn telling this story Michael Keyes fills a key gap in our knowledge by showing us that popular funding was the life blood of Irish nationalism and was the key ingredient in a movement that went from political exclusion to political dominance in nineteenth-century Ireland.<br>Michael Keyes is a writer and part-time lecturer and has completed the PhD thesis upon which this book was based, in NUI Maynooth.<br>\'',7734,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2011-09-30','9780717150007.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,288,'9780717150007',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Leimis Le Cheile Middle Standard\'','','','Gill & Macmillan Ltd','','Children',12,'Language readers; Primary & middle schools; Ireland; Irish Gaelic; Educational: modern (non-native) ','\'A pack of 10 titles from the Leimis Le Cheile series of fiction readers, suitable for Middle standard.<br>A pack of 10 titles from the Leimis Le Cheile series of fiction readers, suitable for Middle standard.

From the uncertain first dawn of human presence on the island, to the defeat of the old Gaelic order at Kinsale in 1602, Hector McDonnell chronicles the lost origins of Ireland\'s \'otherness\'. This scholarly take on Ireland\'s past derives from our prehistoric connections deep within Europe, the Mediterranean and beyond a unique set of circumstances that gave early Irish culture its distinctive character and style. Learn how the arrival via Spain of Bronze Age metalworkers from the Middle East affected the peculiar nature of the Irish language; or how some of our most remarkable monuments, Newgrange included, may owe their existence to ecological catastrophes  -  volcanic eruptions, meteor impacts or near- encounters with comets. As later raids on a weakened Romanized Britain brought back goods and slaves (including St Patrick), a new religion, Christianity, became interwoven with rich ancient traditions and native beliefs.\nThe coming of the Vikings  -  founding the first towns and local kingdoms  -  succeeded in enriching rather than destroying Ireland\'s cultural mix. This pattern was repeated with the arrival of the Normans, which culminated in the Battle of Kinsale, shaping a nation that remains radically distinct and different to the world outside its shores. A lifetime of historical exploration brings together historian and painter Hector McDonnell\'s several passions. His drawings are as illuminating and expressive as the ideas he narrates, and will awaken an',7729,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2013-10-15','9781843516125.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,221,'9781843516125',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'The Humours of \"Planxty\"\'','','','Hachette Books Ireland','http://www.hachette.ie/','Art',1,'Ireland;

This book explores the life of this Limerick native son.<br>This book explores the life of Limerick native son Jim Kemmy, who was an icon of the labour movement in Ireland. Kemmy\'s life spans a period of immense transformation in Irish society with controversy and change in many aspects - Northern Ireland, family planning, industrial relations, religious beliefs, the Labour Party, heritage and the environment are just some of the many issues that engaged him. The book is also significant in that it is a review of a local activist and, in his own language, a working class one. Complementing his political energies, Kemmy emerged as a local writer and historian, initially with the highly controversial journal the Limerick Socialist, and later maturing as editor of the historical Old Limerick Journal. Re-elected to the Dail in 1987, Kemmy rejoined the Labour Party, later becoming chairman for several years, and also on two occasions Mayor of Limerick, still combining all this with a proactive leadership role in the building of trade unions. Most political biographies focus on the \'big players\' with a substantial national or even international profile.\nBut the local actors have their stories to tell too, often stories that illuminate magnificently the forces of change in their society, and stories of people who helped shape their country\'s future. Jim Kemmy\'s is such a story.<br>Brian Callanan is a planner in the Limerick Region and is particularly interested in the history of the area.

In today\'s world of a changing workforce, rapid advancements in technology and increased global competition, learning is more critical than ever. The need to have a long-term vision for education that ensures all students experience success and have the knowledge, skills, abilities and competencies to be successful in the twenty-first century was never more important. Charting some of the significant developments in Ireland in relation to the use of ICT in schools in Ireland, this book is a collection of essays that captures the views of a cross-section of people who have participated in the formulation of ICT policy and in the implementation of digital technologies in school systems in the north and south of Ireland over several decades. The topics covered are diverse, ranging from policy formulation and ICT infrastructure in schools to teacher professional learning and the design of learning environments for learning, teaching and assessment.\nThe value of having such information available in one volume provides evidence of the benefits or otherwise accrued through the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning. In particular, it provides contextual examples of technology \'in action\' in schools across Ireland. Taken together, these highlight the lessons to be learned as well as a range of key enablers and agents that must be addressed as part of any Digital Strategy for schools in Ireland.<br>Dr. Deirdre Butler is a senior lecturer in Education at St. Patrick\'s College, Dublin.

In this period, many of the city\'s modern streets were laid out. A collection of 30 loose sheets present a variety of maps and views illustrating Dublin. Large-scale colour maps depict the city (within the canals) in 1847 at two different scales, which can be compared with a modern town plan of 2012. Historical maps (and similarly illustrations and paintings), such those by Rocque, Scale, the Wide Street Commission and the Ordnance Survey are reproduced to high quality and in large format. Thematic maps depict notable elements of the evolving urban landscape. Cultural and commercial life is opened up to the reader, with records of brewing and distilling, churches, city estates and economic growth phases. The maps are accompanied by a detailed text section with topographical information on Dublin\'s cityscape of factories, schools and shops at its core, and an introductory essay on the growth of Dublin from 1756 to 1847.

Few would look at the ruins on the Great Blasket and imagine a king had lived there. Yet the King was a very forceful presence on this island. The last was Padraig O Cathain, \'Peats Mhici,\' who served for about twenty-five years until his death in 1929. To islanders, he was arguably the most important citizen and was the central figure on the island during its literary flowering. He helped islanders navigate through life and national and world events such as the 1916 Rising and The Great War. He collaborated with the other \'elders\' in planning the transfer of ownership of the island from the Earl of Cork to the Congested Districts Board in 1907 and, in turn, to the islanders themselves. They also participated in the reorganisation of the field system between 1907 and 1917. This is the first account of his extraordinary life, written in collaboration with the King\'s descendants in the USA and Ireland.

The Truce that heralded the end of the War of Independence in July 1921 proved no more than a prelude to renewed conflict on the capital\'s streets as many of the men who worked for Michael Collins in the fight against the British now turned their skills with deadly effect on former comrades. For some Dubliners, including many southern Unionists, British ex-servicemen and anti-Treaty republicans, the city became a hostile environment with the City Council and Dublin Metropolitan Police abolished by the new Free State. Yet, life remained a cycle of grinding poverty for the city\'s slum dwellers. The main beneficiary of the chaos was the Catholic Church, which tightened its grip on vital social services with tragic consequences for thousands of the marginalised, while an embattled government was too preoccupied with securing its grip on power to provide for its own citizens. As in his previous work, the author uncovers unknown and neglected aspects of the Irish revolution in the capital and their impact on the rest of the country.\nPraise for Padraig Yeates\' \'Dublin at War\' trilogy \'A powerful social history ...reminds us that for all the headline grabbing events, putting bread on the table was still the most important priority for most\' Professor Diarmaid Ferriter, The Irish Independent \'Reminds the reader of how daily life went on side by side with the great events of history.

As Seamus Deane has written, reconciliation stands at a nexus between politics and aesthetics in Irish writing, and has therefore often been a vehicle of colonial ideology.<br>Largely inspired by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission of the 1990s, scholars from a range of disciplines have produced numerous books and conferences on the topic of reconciliation around the world over the past two decades.  This book provides a literary genealogy of the concept in Ireland, where W.B. Yeats, Conor Cruise O\'Brien, Tom Paulin, and Seamus Heaney have all associated it, paradoxically enough, with Sophoclean tragedy.  In the early twentieth century Yeats borrowed a theory of cultural Hellenism from Matthew Arnold in order to promote the Abbey Theatre as a reconciling institution in the Irish Free State.  In the 1960s Conor Cruise O\'Brien espoused Arnoldian Hellenism but nevertheless used Antigone as an analogy for explaining why reconciliation in Northern Ireland was impossible.  In the 1980s, the Field Day Theatre Company revived the Aristotelian notion that drama  -  exemplified by Sophoclean tragedy  -  was a civic art that could promote the cause of reconciliation.  For example, in his The Riot Act: A Version of Sophocles\' Antigone (1984), Tom Paulin explored the conflict between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft.Heaney was also at that time beginning to associate Sophoclean choruses with the poetry of human rights.\nThis study culminates with a genealogical analysis of Heaney\'s The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles\' Philoctetes (1990), a play whose \"hope and history\" chorus came to be often quoted during the Northern Irish peace process.<br>Nathan Wallace is an Assistant Professor of English, Ohio State University, Marion, Ohio<br>\'',7666,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2015-06-30','9781782050681.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,204,'9781782050681',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'To School Through the Fields\'','','','O\'Brien Press Ltd','http://www.obrien.ie/','Biography',6,'Ireland; Memoirs; Ireland; ; Taylor, Alice - Childhood and youth; Country life - Ireland - Cork (Cou','\'Her classic account of growing up in the Irish countryside, the biggest selling book ever published in Ireland.<br>Alice Taylor\'s classic account of growing up in the Irish countryside, the biggest selling book ever published in Ireland.<br>A delightful evocation of Irishness and of the author\'s deep-rooted love of \"the very fields of home\" ... with its rituals and local characters Publisher\'s Weekly One of the most richly evocative and moving portraits of childhood ever written.

When she married, she moved to Innishannon where she ran a guesthouse at first, then the supermarket and post office. She and her husband, Gabriel Murphy, who sadly passed away in 2005, had four sons and one daughter.

To School Through the Fields was published in May 1988. It was an immediate success, launching Alice on a series of signing sessions, talks and readings the length and breadth of Ireland.

Recent accidents have caused concern for the safety of the visitors to the rocky outcrop but from the sixth to the thirteenth century, Skellig Michael was home to a monastic community that built the \'treacherous\' steps and \'dangerous\' walkways. Many have wondered about the life of the monks on the rock centuries ago. In this remarkable and refreshing feat of imagination and reconstruction Geoffrey Moorhouse shows how this community worshipped and survived from c500 to 1200AD.  Shortlisted for the Booker in 1997, the book is in two parts: in the first, Moorhouse gets inside the minds and austere world of the monks in a fictionalised description of their life, beginning with their arrival on the island and their withdrawal from the world to a life of prayer and fasting, hardship and danger. Subsequent scenes depict aspects of Celtic spirituality, a Viking raid and finally, the departure of the abbot and his aging disciples from the island following a severe storm.The second part is a collection of short essays setting out the evidence for the detail in the first part, and describes the many features of medieval monastic life.\nTopics covered include the conversion of the Irish to Christianity, Celtic monasticism, lives of early saints and scholars, wildlife and more recent history of the Skelligs.<br>Author\'s Note i  PART ONE The Tradition ONE AD 588 3 TWO AD 670 17 THREE AD 780 30 FOUR AD 824 47 FIVE A',7654,'2016-02-08 00:00:00','2009-05-31','9781848890046.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,256,'9781848890046',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'The Songman: A Journey in Irish Music\'','','','The Lilliput Press Ltd','','Biography',6,'Folk & traditional music; Ireland; Biography: arts & entertainment; Traditional & folk music; Folk s','\'\'With a Fenian fiddle in one ear and an Orange drum in the other\', singer Tommy Sands was reared in the foothills of the Mourne mountains, where he still lives.

Soon after learning the fiddle himself, Sands began writing his own songs. During the 1960s and 1970s he was the chief songwriter with The Sands Family, who played wherever they were welcome, from local wakes and weddings to New York\'s Carnegie Hall.

The given reason for his commitment was an attack on his sister-in-law, Mary Ryan, wife of his brother Michael. The true reason: a homosexual affair with a hedonistic young man who introduced him to art, literature and music. When he returns to his family, Mary continues to insist on Willie\'s insanity. After all, didn\'t he refuse to go to Confession or to attend Mass during all his years in the asylum? Together with Father Mannix - who was complicit in \'putting away\' Willie - she conspires to bring about Willie\'s reconciliation with the church. For Willie\'s enemies, nothing evil has happened as long as it is not seen to have happened.

The famine was the defining event of nineteenth-century Irish history, and nineteenth-century Europe\'s greatest natural disaster, killing about one million people and prompting many hundreds of thousands more to emigrate. The subjects covered here include: trends in living standards before the famine; the impact of the crisis on landlords; the characteristics of famine mortality; the market for potatoes during the 1840s; the role of migration as disaster relief; the New York Irish in the wake of the famine; the famine in folklore and memory, and in comparative perspective; and the historiography of the famine in Ireland. Ireland\'s Great Famine includes four previously unpublished essays, together with others assembled from a wide range of publications in different fields.

Covering the period from the game\'s origins in Ireland in the 1870s through to the onset of professional rugby in the twenty-first century, this book seeks to examine Munster rugby within the context of broader social, cultural and political trends in Irish society. As well as providing a thorough chronological survey of the game\'s development, key themes such as violence, masculinity, class and politics are subject to more detailed treatment. Since the turn of the twenty-first century rugby football in Munster has seen extraordinary growth in terms of popularity and cultural significance. The Munster rugby team in particular has become a hugely important provincial institution through which regional identity has been expressed on the international stage. This book will detail and analyse the game\'s evolution in Munster from its origins in the 1870s through to the dawn of the professional era in the 2000s.\nFocusing mainly on the game\'s two centres of popularity in Limerick and Cork cities, this book will display how contrary to popular myth, rugby football rarely expressed any kind of unitary, coherent identity throughout the province. The game was centred on clubs and was highly adaptable to local conditions throughout its history.  In addition, the often fractious internal politics of the game within the province, reflecting the game\'s contrasting social development in Limerick and Cork, will also be discussed.

This book offers an insight into the life and career of one of our most gifted singers.<br>For the last thirty years, singer Mary Black has been a dominant presence on the Irish music scene, an award-winning artist with many bestselling albums to her name. Now, in this long-awaited memoir, Mary takes us back to the roots of her musical heritage and to the influences that helped to shape her as an artist and a woman. Born into a musical family, Mary Black - a feisty tomboy who could hold her own when it came to sparring with her brothers and anyone else brave enough to take her on - began singing folk songs from the age of ten. Music played an important role in the family home and, performing with her brothers and her sister Frances, Mary built her highly successful career on the bedrock of these early years. From the pubs and clubs of her hometown, Dublin, she went on to perform in some of the most prestigious venues across the world. Always committed to exploring new material from the best writers, her unique talent attracted acclaim from critics, fellow artists and the public alike. It also led to a host of bestselling albums, including the multi-platinum No Frontiers, which spent more than a year in the Irish Top 30.\nMary\'s love of singing was matched only by the love she had for her family. As she recalls the inevitable tensions that arose when trying to juggle family life and a high-profile career, she tells of her struggle to combine the two contrasting aspects of her life. It was only through gritty determination, hard work and a fair amount of laughter that Mary was able to enjoy major success as an artist and, at the same time, raise a close and loving family with her husband Joe.

The period saw Trinity and its environs profoundly changed. The book uses Trinity as a way of exploring some of the central themes and tensions of these years, themes that are usually examined separately: Irish involvement in the First World War; the Easter Rising of 1916; the violent struggle for Irish independence; the end of the Civil War; and the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. It views these events through the prism of the university\'s development, arguing that these contexts cannot be divorced from one another. Trinity was at the centre- physically, intellectually, symbolically-of these seismic events in local, national and international history, and each had a great impact upon the institution and its development in the twentieth century. Cumulatively, they transformed the university by 1923.<br>Tomas Irish is lecturer in modern history in the Department of History and Classics, Swansea University.

Forty-six years later, disillusioned with the polarisation of American society, he returns to Ireland and decides to write about his experiences.<br>In 1962, Ed Deevy, a young Irishman who had grown up as a farm boy in County Laois, ar-rived in Louisiana as a newly-minted Catholic priest. After seven years working in Cajun Country he discarded the Roman Collar and joined President Johnson\'s War on Poverty. Working on the front lines of the civil rights movement in Baton Rouge he had more than a few memorable experiences. The soft-spoken Irishman would be branded as an \'agitator\' by the local U.S. Congressman and would later be booted out of the anti-poverty programme.  Moving north to Western Massachusetts Ed takes up a new job in Holyoke as manager of a programme designed to provide support for individuals discharged from the local mental hospital. After three years, suffering from fatigue, he decides to retreat to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where he pursues study towards a doctorate in organizational behaviour. After obtaining the degree he accepts a short-term position as a Visiting Professor at the University. He then moves on to a new career as a management consultant. In 1995 he published Creating the Resilient Organization (Prentice Hall), a book sharing insights on engaging and motivating employees.After 9/11 Deevy became concerned about the increasing polarization of American society.\nThe weak response by President George W. Bush to Hurricane Katrina and the drowning of New Orleans increased his concerns about the drift of American society. Bush\'s decision to invade Iraq, based on what George Galloway called a \"pack of lies\", led Deevy to a decision to return to the land of his birth.

Eamon de Valera, Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith and a host of other participants come to life. The colourful descriptions of the scene and of the reactions to speeches, written while the debates were in progress, are far more revealing than the published record of the debates.

First introduced in a small number of schools in 1974, the programme has grown dramatically since mainstreaming in 1994. Transition Year in Action presents accounts of how a range of schools engage with the challenges of TY. The book illustrates some of the creativity and imagination being applied to offer teenagers educational experiences that contribute to their maturity, and demonstrates how individual teachers engage their students in active learning. The book engages with many aspects of TY programmes including work experience, mini-companies, community service, fundraising activities, musicals and learning beyond the classroom as well as TY-specific modules, sampling modules and \'linear\' or \'continutiy\' subjects. Transition Year in Action also explores aspects of co-ordination, resources, school leadership and research.Through the voices of students, parents, teachers, co-ordinators, principals and researchers, Transition Year in Action provides a nuanced picture of the breadth and complexity of Transition Year as it sits uncomfortably between Junior Cycle and the demands of the Leaving Certificate.\nThe book will offer inspiration as well as practice guidance to anyone interested in making the Transition Year vision a reality, whether they are approaching the programme for the first time or seeking to refresh and sustain established programmes.<br>Gerry Jeffers is an educational researcher and lecturer.

Civil War in Ulster, originally published in 1913, analyses the events leading up to the massive arming of the Orangemen which followed the Larne gun-running. Joseph Johnston was an Ulster Protestant writing as a liberal supporter of Home Rule. He gives the book\'s target Protestant readership an outline of recent Irish history, making the case that Home Rule had many positive features, and that none of the perceived negative features would be worth fighting a civil war to avoid. Although Johnston\'s objective in writing the book was unsuccessful and the point of view has been largely forgotten, his highly readable book provides a fascinating insight into the thoughts and fears of the population of Ulster at a critical time in Irish history and the foreword and introduction, by Tom Garvin and Roy Johnston, give a contemporary analysis of the thinking behind Johnston\'s unusual stand.<br>Series Introduction; Foreword; Introduction; Introduction - Object in Writing; The Supposed Danger in Protestantism; Church and State in Various Countries; Objects of Ulster\'s Resistance; Importance of Ulster to the Unionist Parties; Probable Course of Events; Ireland from 1782-1800; Ireland from 1801-1870; Ireland from 1871 to the Present Day; Examination of the Home Rule Bill; Appendix.<br>Joseph Johnston (1890-1972) had a distinguished career as a Fellow of Trinity College Dublin',7548,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2015-10-01','9781906359959.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,224,'9781906359959',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Business Law in Ireland\'','','','Clarus Press Ltd','','Law',39,'Ireland; Company, commercial & competition law: general; Ireland; ; National Law: Professional; ANF:','\'\'',7544,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2015-09-20','9781905536771.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,342,'9781905536771',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Rising Out: Sean Connolly of Longford\'','','','University College Dublin Press','','Biography',6,'Military history; Battles & campaigns; British & Irish history; Ireland; 20th century; Biography: hi','\'The Centenary Classics series examines the change and evolution in the Ireland of 100 years ago during the 1916-23 revolutionary period.

Each volume is introduced by Fearghal McGarry who sets the scene of this important period in Ireland\'s history. Rising Out tells the story of Brigadier Sean Connolly, O/C of the Longford Brigade, who was fatally wounded in action on 11 March 1921 at Selton Hill, near Mohill (Co. Leitrim), by British forces during the War of Independence. Comdt-General Ernie O\'Malley came across the story in interviews with Tan and Civil War survivors in the early 1950s. The account makes Connolly come alive as a person - his schooling, love of music, education, farming family background and devotion to the nationalist cause.

Michael Longley\'s lectures were published in June 2015 and the next volume will contain the lectures of Paula Meehan. In this volume, the distinguished Dublin poet Harry Clifton - who has lived and worked all over the globe - focuses on locating himself and other Irish poets in relation to the literary traditions of Britain, Europe and the United States. Clifton opens by recounting his time living in London in the late eighties and early nineties. He discusses how he and a group of other poets were part of London\'s \'cultural clutter\', and how their poetry reckoned with a time of great social and political upheaval in Britain. The second lecture focusses on Irish poetry\'s place in the \'eternal present\' of Europe.\nPatrick Kavanagh and Thomas Kinsella are among the poets discussed in this illuminating comparison between neighbouring nations. Clifton closes the collection by extending his discussion on poetry to the United States - a land of exiles and immigrants. From Derek Mahon to Oscar Wilde, Clifton examines Irish poets in the New World, and describes how America has come to mean \'artistic posterity\' for many of them.

In 1586 she was captured by the Earl of Ormond and was actually on the scaffold with a rope around her neck when she was saved on the orders of Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth offered to make her a countess. Grace refused, but was officially allowed to be a privateer thereafter.

Over a fifty-year career she sang at sell-out concerts from small halls across Ireland to leading venues such as the London Palladium, Royal Albert Hall, the Lincoln Centre in New York and the Sydney Opera House. She brought glamour to show business in Ireland, and gave new life to forgotten Irish ballads. Her rise to fame began in the mid-1950s and was marked by enormous crowds wherever she appeared, as she won the hearts of legions of fans loyal ever since.

Blake\'s haunting images of crumbling ruins and history of the churches tell another fascinating story of troubled times.<br>This latest book by Tarquin Blake documents eighty abandoned Church of Ireland churches, preserving a record of fragile religious ruins. Their history, dating back to early Christianity in Ireland, paints a stark portrait of a Protestant aristocracy and a Catholic majority. Under the 1801 Act of Union, the Church of Ireland was united with the Church of England.  Following this about GBP1 million ( 100 million in today\'s money) was spent building over 700 Protestant churches. The Church of Ireland was the Established Church and Protestantism the official religion. Most Irish resented the Church of Ireland, a minority church controlled by Englishmen, unsympathetic and friends of the landlords. As Protestant congregations declined in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries an attempt was made to keep churches open by uniting parishes. Eventually non-existent congregations forced closure of many churches. Valuables were removed, churches deconsecrated and abandoned. Blake\'s haunting images of crumbling ruins and history of the churches tell another fascinating story of troubled times.<br>Tarquin Blake, architectural explorer, photographer and historian, is author of Abandoned Mansions of Ireland, Ancient Ireland and Haunted Ireland and of the website www.AbandonedIreland.com.

Over the last fifty years an array of resources and interventions have been brought to bear on domestic violence and abuse between intimate partners. Yet intimate abuse continues to be endemic in our society. One of the principal reasons for this lack of effective intervention is that we have ignored a critical ingredient which is the foundation of long-term intimate abuse and violence. This book uncovers the layers of covert tactics which men employ to establish and maintain control over their intimate partner. By deepening our understanding of what is going on the author suggests that we can develop a more efficient and consistent response to the issue.  Working with both the perpetrators and victims of intimate partner abuse has given the author a unique insight into the tactics employed by the male abuser. He suggests that male intimate abuse and violence are driven by an entitlement to sexual priority and that the other tactics of control and violence are motivated by this entitlement.\nIt is this motivation that distinguishes male intimate violence from other forms of \'domestic violence\' such as female to male violence and elder abuse.  The author details the similarities in tactics and motivation between the paedophile and the male intimate abuser. He has found that by explaining these tactics to victims he has released many of them from the mind-control that they have experienced.<br>Don Hennessy is the Director of the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency (NDVIA)<br>\'',7537,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2012-08-24','9781855942202.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,273,'9781855942202',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Beamish & Crawford: The History of an Irish Brewery\'','','','The Collins Press','http://www.collinspress.ie/','Humanities',41,'Social & cultural history; Beers; Ireland; c 1800 to c 1900; 20th century; 21st century; Industriali','\'The story of over two centuries of an iconic Irish brewery and the people who worked there.

Inspired by the story of her relative Marion Stokes, one of three women who raised the tricolour over Enniscorthy in Easter Week 1916, Felicity Hayes-McCoy explores the consequences for all of us when memories are manipulated or obliterated, intentionally or by chance. In the power struggle after the Easter Rising, which involved Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera among others, the ideals for which Marion and her companions fought were eroded, resulting in an Ireland marked by chauvinism, isolationism and secrecy. By mapping her own family stories onto the history of the state, Felicity examines how Irish life today has been affected by the censorship and mixed messages of the past.

He worked every day from the 1930s until 1985 aged eighty-four. Unknowingly, he became the unofficial family photographer of a city, having taken a estimated 182,500 photos of passers-by. When cameras were not within reach of normal people, Arthur provided a vital service taking photos of couples on first dates, people up in Dublin for a day, happy parents with newborn children, match-goers, and many more. These cherished photos form the basis of this collection. Each photo was submitted by its owner with a story and caption explaining the background. The photos bear witness to a changing cityscape, fashion, lifestyle, social habits and even camera technology. In terms of subjects, Arthur didn\'t just photograph everyday people but also famous celebrities, African princes, street characters and even future stars, such as a seven-year-old George Harrison, with his mother. The result is a window to an era when times were so different and photographs were taken to be cherished.\nThis is a uniquely crowd-sourced publication, the culmination of the Man on Bridge project, a national photo collection campaign.<br>\"Extraordinary social record.\" Irish Examiner \"Absolute delight.\" The Sunday Business Post \"Most unique archive of 20th century Dublin photographs.\" Herald<br>Arthur Fields lived in the Dublin suburb of Raheny.

It is also full of tradition, emotion, memories, and a magnificent sense of fair play and good humour. Here its history is traced in a colourful and entertaining style, highlighting great games played and great characters who graced the arena. Since the first game there in 1934, Thomond Park has become one of the world\'s iconic rugby venues.  It is famous for many great occasions, notably Munster\'s 1978 defeat of the All Blacks.  More recently, it has hosted memorable Heineken European Cup games involving Munster.  The \'Miracle Match\' against Gloucester in 2003 stands out for many.  In 2008 the glittering new Thomond Park Stadium was opened on the same site at Hassetts Cross.

In April 1916, the Easter Rising broke out in Dublin. History remembers it as Irish rebel against English soldier, but the truth is more complicated. Thousands of British army soldiers in the Rising were Irishmen, including Second-Lieutenant Robert Barton from Glendalough, who later became a Sinn Fein TD and a signatory of the Anglo-Irish Truce, the infamous Captain John Bowen-Colthurst on whose orders Francis Sheehy-Skeffington was executed, and the eclectic scientist and inventor Prof. John Joly from Co.

They have inspired poets and painters, and feature in many legends and place names. Here Niall Mac Coitir provides a comprehensive look at the mythology, legends and folklore of Irish birds, both wild and domestic. He presents various aspects of bird folklore, such as fairy birds, birds of notable song or beauty, birds in the Brehon Laws and in early Irish poetry, and legends, such as the Children of Lir being turned into swans and how the banshee often appeared in the form of a crow, are featured. The birds are presented in seasonal order based either on their migratory habits, for example the cuckoo in summer, or on their cultural associations, such as the robin at Christmas. Also explored is how birds are often powerful symbols of various virtues and qualities, such as the goose, which is a symbol of watchfulness and bravery.Written with imagination and enthusiasm, this mix of natural history, mythology and folklore will entertain and enlighten all interested in the birds of Ireland.<br>\'Will entertain and enlighten.\' Irish Independent<br>Niall Mac Coitir grew up in a bilingual environment in Dublin with a love of Irish history, culture and nature instilled into him.

When Peter Stringer played youth rugby, he was so small that people told his parents he shouldn\'t be allowed on the pitch. Fortunately for Munster and for Ireland, they paid no attention. Over 200 provincial caps and 98 international caps later, Stringer is a legend. Since making his Munster debut in 1998, his lightning-quick passing, sniping breaks and brave defending have electrified fans - never more so than when he deceived the entire Biarritz team at a scrum to sneak in for the try that brought Munster its first Heineken Cup in 2006.  In Ireland\'s breakthrough season of 2009, his man-of-the-match performance at Murrayfield helped overturn a late deficit en route to the Six Nations Grand Slam.

Unless something happened to Clucko, Leonard was always going to be number 2. Of course, it didn\'t help that he had a problem with drink and drugs...Dub Sub Confidential is John Leonard\'s vivid, witty and searingly honest account of his life in and out of sport. He was both a committed Dub and a sceptical observer of the goings on in the dressing-room and on the training pitch. He writes about the players and the mentors, and about the oddity of being part of the GAA\'s biggest circus while never expecting to get on the pitch.

His books have won critical acclaim in many quarters and have been widely translated. His writings range from local history and reminiscence to politics and short stories, and they include the fullest and most authoritative exposition of modern Irish republicanism.     Born in West Belfast in 1948 into a family with close ties to both the trade union and republican movements, Gerry Adams is the eldest of ten children. His mother was an articulate and gentle woman, his father a republican activist who had been jailed at the age of sixteen, and he was partly reared by his grandmother, who nurtured in him a love of reading.     His childhood, despite its material poverty, he has described in glowing and humorous terms, recollecting golden hours spent playing on the slopes of the mountain behind his home and celebrating the intimate sense of community in the tightly packed streets of working-class West Belfast. But even before leaving school to work as a barman, he had become aware of the inequities and inequalities of life in the north of Ireland. Soon he was engaged in direct action on the issues of housing, unemployment and civil rights.     For many years his voice was banned from radio and television by both the British and Irish governments, while commentators and politicians condemned him and all he stood for. But through those years his books made an important contribution to an understanding of the true circumstances of life and politics in the north of Ireland.     James F.

They tore through the skies in flimsy biplanes. They soared across the seas in battleships. They charged across the tortured earth with bayonets fixed. They wrapped bandages and dabbed softly in the field hospitals. They prayed, they sang, they killed, they wept and they died. Popular historian Turtle Bunbury is renowned for uncovering important forgotten stories from our past. Here he reveals many never-before-heard tales of the Irish heroes and heroines whose lives coincided with one of the most brutal conflicts our world has ever known - including nuns, artists, sportsmen, poets, aristocrats, nationalists, nurses, clergymen and film directors. By turns poignant, enlightening, whimsical and darkly comic, this is history as it should be - free-wheeling and finely tuned to the rhythms of the human heart. <iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ymunXEKHgPI?list=UUjplKQ0w7-mgiGelQeiqn-A\" width=\"370\" height=\"208\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> REVIEWS \'Magnificent book...a superb production...something to be proud of...\'\nGay Byrne on Sunday with Gay Byrne, Lyric FM. \'An absolutely beautiful book...A lavish production with lots of pictures, lots of maps - it really captures the whole era.\' Patrick Geoghegan on Talking History, Newstalk FM \'A piece of Irish history that was sort of wilfully forgotten for a long time.

Then meet the young, new thinkers of Ireland as they share their vision for the future. Here, twenty-one of our leading creative thinkers and problem-solvers rip up the rule book and start again, presenting a new vision for Ireland. They cover a diverse range of topics that affect all our lives, from Art to Diaspora, Religion to Research and, of course, Banking. These are tomorrow\'s leaders. The future is bright. Some essays propose extreme ideas: imagining democratically run companies, three-day working weeks, a Google bank, and safer roads bereft of signs or markings; while others put forward very possible ways in which Ireland can become a global leader in areas in which we already excel. In most instances, contributors have looked to the past - the psyche and make-up of Irish life - to inform their vision of the future. In others, they have referenced current successes. This is a book about being Irish, about being resilient and, as surprising as it may sound, about overcoming current hardships and standing as a model for other countries to follow.<br>Louise Hodgson is programme director of The Undergraduate Awards (UA), an initiative founded in Ireland in 2008 to celebrate the brightest students who propose fresh arguments and new approaches in their studies.

Documents chart the complex reorientation of the relationship between Ireland and Britain. The volume prioritises Ireland\'s role in the League of Nations and its diplomatic movements on the wider international stage.<br>Volume IV of Documents on Irish Foreign Policy covers an eventful period of Irish foreign policy, from 10 March 1932 to 31 December 1936. It saw the first Fianna Fail administration led by a wilful Eamon de Valera, who was both President and Minister for External Affairs. The records show how de Valera and his officials set about restructuring the framework of British-Irish relations and dismantling the 1921 Treaty. Legislation facilitating the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance was introduced, land annuity payments due to Britain were withheld, and the office of Governor General was downgraded. A breakthrough in trade relations occurred when Britain imposed prohibitive tariffs following Ireland\'s retention of annuities, and Irish officials had to look abroad in search of alternative markets. De Valera expanded in size and influence of the Department of External Affairs, and politicians such as Joseph P. Walshe (Secretary of the DEA) and John W. Dulanty (Irish High Commissioner in London) were given unprecedented latitude in the tactical execution of policy. The volume reveals a personal dimension to Walshe\'s close professional relationship with de Valera.\nIt offers a picture of Ireland in the 1930s enjoying unparalleled involvement on the wider international stage. Through the League of Nations diplomatic links with Europe and the USA strengthened and, on the eve of the Spanish Civil War, an Irish legation opened in Madrid. Documents charting the run up to the Second World War appear at the close of this exciting volume.<br>\'',7456,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2004-01-06','9781904890034.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,595,'9781904890034',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Lines for Living\'','','','Hachette Books Ireland','http://www.hachette.ie/','Literature',42,'REFERENCE / Quotations; Anthologies: general; ; Anthologies, Essays, Letters & Miscellaneous; ANF:Li','\'\'',7452,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2012-09-03','9781444725315.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,304,'9781444725315',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Any Dream Will Do\'','','','Hachette Books Ireland','http://www.hachette.ie/','Fiction',11,'Modern & contemporary fiction; ; General & Literary Fiction; AF:General; AF: General; ','\'\'',7453,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2012-06-18','9781444726060.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,352,'9781444726060',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Dear Sebastian: A Father\'s Last Wish, a Legacy of Inspiration\'','','','Hachette Books Ireland','http://www.hachette.ie/','Lifestyle',38,'Anthologies (non-poetry); Self-help & personal development; Anthologies: general; ; Self Improvement','\'\'',7454,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2010-01-23','9780340994818.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,272,'9780340994818',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Documents on Irish Foreign Policy\'','','','Royal Irish Academy','','Humanities',41,'HISTORY / Europe / Ireland; 20th century history: c 1900  to c 2000; International relations; Irelan','\'Volume II details the Irish Free State\'s first steps as a player on the international stage, including: its admission to the League of Nations, the development of Irish-US relations and the government\'s policy towards the Boundary Commission, which defined the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.<br>Volume II in the Documents on Irish Foreign Policy series concerns the establishment of the Irish Free State as a sovereign, independent state on the international stage. The opening date of the volume, 6 December 1922, marks the establishment of the Irish Free State under the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. The closing date, 19 March 1926, is that of the Ultimate Financial Agreement between the Irish Free State and Britain. This volume presents the first exclusive account of the Irish government\'s policy towards the Boundary Commission, the relationship which was to define the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The first steps in the creation of the state are chronicled, including Ireland\'s admission to the League of Nations and the appointment of Ireland\'s first overseas envoy, Professor T.A. Smiddy, as Minister Plenipotentiary to the US. Volume II offers close insight into the development of Irish-American relations and the fraught negotiations surrounding the Boundary Commission and its collapse.

He died agonizingly from dysentery in a military hospital in the south of England, to which he had just been sent from France. His mother and eleven-year-old brother Denis had made the grim journey from Armagh to be with him. The sight of his beloved and admired brother dying in such distress seemed likely to haunt Denis forever.Years later Denis became a missionary priest in Burma. In 1941 the Japanese routed the British army there and captured his fellow priests, but his remote mission station remained undiscovered. In that sense he was untouched by World War II; yet this war recruited his active compassion, and did so in such a way that he finally laid to rest his ghost of Tom.Drawing on family recollections, letters, military records and memoirs, and the archives of the Columban Missionary Society, the author tells a strange and moving story about the early life and war experiences of his two uncles, a story with symmetry of a kind seldom found in the haphazard events of real life; a story too about war and its horrors that finally consoles.<br>\'',7424,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2008-10-30','9781843511458.jpg','','','','','',0,1,0,0,256,'9781843511458',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Respond to Your Heart\'','','','SOL Productions Ltd','','Lifestyle',38,'Mind, body, spirit: thought & practice; Mind, Body & Spirit: General; ANF:Religion; ANF: Religion; ','\'\'',7419,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2002-11-30','9781901712124.jpg','','','','','',0,0,0,1,0,'9781901712124',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Thoughts to Power Your Life\'','','','SOL Productions Ltd','','Lifestyle',38,'Mind, body, spirit: thought & practice; Mind, Body & Spirit: General; ANF:Religion; ANF: Religion; ','\'\'',7420,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','1997-11-30','9781901712018.jpg','','','','','',0,0,0,1,0,'9781901712018',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Bereavement a Healing Meditation\'','','','SOL Productions Ltd','','Lifestyle',38,'Coping with death & bereavement; Coping with Problems & Illness; ANF:Family and Relationships; ANF: ','\'\'',7421,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2004-11-30','9781901712155.jpg','','','','','',0,0,0,1,0,'9781901712155',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Irish Voices from the Great War<br>New Revised Ed.\'','','','Merrion Press','','Humanities',41,'HISTORY / Military / World War I; BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / General; British & Irish history; 20th','\'\'',7409,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2014-07-31','9781908928818.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,280,'9781908928818',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Murder Will Out: Irish Murder Cases\'','','','Gill & Macmillan Ltd','','Biography',6,'FAMILY & RELATIONSHIPS / Abuse / Child Abuse; SOCIAL SCIENCE / Sexual Abuse & Harassment; Ireland; T','\'Tells the story of ten sensational Irish murders solved by the skills of the Garda Technical Bureau using a mixture of old-fashioned detective work and modern forensic science.<br>Murder Will Out tells the story of ten sensational Irish murders and how they were solved.

Seven days later she was torpedoed off the Irish coast with the loss of 1,198 lives.  Suspected by the Germans of carrying clandestine munitions to Britain, the great ship steamed into a fatal encounter with the German submarine U-20. One of the largest naval disasters in history, it was a factor in bringing America into the First World War. Patrick O\'Sullivan presents the complete story of the Lusitania affair, exploring the cover-ups and the theories on what caused the baffling second explosion. His meticulous research reveals the most compelling explanation to date. This is a fascinating account of one of the First World War\'s most reported-on atrocities.<br>Patrick O\'Sullivan, born in Cork, grew up hearing old fishermen\'s tales of German U-Boats that stalked the shores during the Great War.

In presenting 10 of Dublin\'s most historic buildings, we encounter the great periods of building activity, the people involved and the institutions that inhabited these buildings. Behind the facades is the story of Dublin, bringing to life key events and characters from the past. The buildings include: Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin\'s oldest church; the colonisers\' castle, Dublin Castle; the first seat of learning, Trinity College Dublin; the Old Parliament House (Bank of Ireland); the centre of civic life, City Hall; Kilmainham Gaol, where leaders of the rebellions of 1798, 1803, 1848, 1867 and 1916 were detained; St James\' Gate Brewery, home of Guinness; the iconic GPO, the last great Georgian public building erected; the National Theatre and \'cradle of Irish drama\', the Abbey; and Croke Park, home of the Gaelic Athletic association and a cathedral of sport. These survive as tangible reminders of Dublin in the past and help shape the city landscape today.\nBringing together the story of these ten of Dublin\'s landmark buildings takes us on a wonderful journey through the shifting social, political and cultural history of Ireland\'s capital.<br>\'A joy of a book\' Ireland AM, TV3 \'Impressive\' Irish Mirror \'Handsome and engaging account.\' History Ireland<br>Lisa Marie Griffith from Waterford studied history at University College Dublin and a PhD at Trinity College.

Lawrence, the enigmatic desert fighter, aircraftman and writer. The result of years of painstaking research, this book contains new material that throws a completely fresh light on Lawrence\'s concealed private life. Following an extraordinary journey to find the unknown man behind the many myths, the book\'s two halves are woven together by the author\'s personal mission to reveal the man behind the mask; the secret Lawrence. Part One reveals Lawrence\'s lost Irish heritage - his father\'s real family (the aristocratic, Anglo-Irish Chapmans), his abandoned half-sisters (with evocative interviews), his illegitimacy, and his mother\'s obscure forebears. The author shows, for the first time, that his titled and wealthy Irish family\'s refusal to acknowledge him affected Lawrence far more deeply than previously thought; and a surprising truth emerges - that he thought of himself not as English but as Irish. The book\'s compelling narrative is powerfully supported by a wide range of previously unpublished photographs.\nThese include two of his father, Thomas Chapman, a complete Chapman family sequence and views of Killua Castle and South Hill, the family seats in Westmeath.The second part, which follows the author\'s adventurous travels to the Middle East in search of Lawrence\'s lost love, has a surprising denouement - a convincing solution to the mysterious and cryptic dedication to S.A. of his book, Seven Pillars of Wisdom. The author also presents new evidence to vindicate Lawrence\'s account in the Seven Pillars of the brutal sexual assault on him at Deraa during the Arab Revolt of 1916-18, a controversial episode that has often been questioned.<br>Dick Benson-Gyles, who lives in Plym',7392,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2016-03-01','','','','','','',1,0,0,0,328,'9781843516569',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Romancing Ireland: Richard Hayward, 1892 - 1964\'','','','The Lilliput Press Ltd','','Biography',6,'PERFORMING ARTS / Film & Video / General; Films, cinema; Individual actors & performers; Biography: ','\'Richard Hayward was one of Ireland\'s best loved cultural figures from the mid-twentieth century, yet now has been all but forgotten. This first biography commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of his death, and retrieves the legacy of a man who captured a changing Ireland.<br>Richard Hayward was one of Ireland\'s best loved cultural figures from the mid-twentieth century. A popular singer and actor (The Luck of the Irish, 1939) , he also wrote travel books (In Praise of Ulster,1938), led groups on tours of Ireland, and was a theatrical impresario; in between times he was a salesman for Fox\'s Glacier Mints and a chocolate sweet company. A largely forgotten figure in the Irish cultural world, Hayward left behind a formidable body of work in books and recordings. He moved easily between parallel worlds of film making, the theatre, broadcasting and singing and writing, and his life touched many people. In this painstakingly researched account of an extraordinary life, Paul Clements has mastered a huge amount of material. The book covers all of his life, providing fresh insights through the lens of remarkable material from hitherto unknown archive resources, and a wealth of rare photographs.\nPaul Clements has scrutinised thousands of documents and literary fragments in archives throughout Ireland and Britain, producing a balanced reflection on Hayward\'s books, songs, films and ideas, which tell the extraordinary story of his four decades in the public spotlight. This absorbing and timely biography, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Hayward\'s death in 1964, draws on an array of primary sources, including previously unseen letters, and paints a refreshingly readable portrait of the man and his times. A landmark book, it is the first biography of a man who captured a changing Ireland and retrieves his legacy.<br>The author: Paul Clements is a writer, broadcaster and journalist.

Melosina Lenox- Conyngham\'s writings are rich with a delightful sense of humour and her ironic, quizzical pleasure in the world is contagious.<br>Born a Teaplanter\'s daughter in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1941, and evacuated with her mother to southern Africa during the war, Melosina Lenox-Conyngham acquired early on a taste for travel and an interest in life\'s curiosities, qualities well illustrated in this gathering of her writings. Here be memories of school holidays spent with an aunt in Cork, the dubious pleasures of church in Carrigadrohid, the eventful history of the Cork and County Club, sketches of life in the family home in Ravensdale, County Louth, where generations of the Lenox-Conynghams have lived, in which we learn of the mystery of the magic tap and an unusual form of family funerals. Her years of service as Secretary to the Butler Society lent her expertise at rallying the clan as well as a special interest in key figures from Kilkenny local history: Canon Carrigan, author of the History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory; William Colles, creator of the Maddoxtown Marble Works; Walter Butler, who played a key part in the Thirty Years War as the assassin of Wallenstein.\nVignettes of Irish social life introduce us to houses never sold and fill readers in on the eventful history of the Duchess of Devonshire. Some of the most intriguing essays detail travels to remote parts of the globe, to Yemen, the home of the legendary Queen of Sheba, to Nagaland in the far north-east of India, or to Timbuktu in Mali. But even if only a visit to a restaurant in Barcelona where food is served entirely in the dark, or to an artists\' centre high in the Pyrenees, the amused gaze of the writer brings the experience vividly to life.

With about 300 activists in County Kildare, and only about a third of them ready to take to the field at one time, they faced nearly 6,000 troops and hundreds of police and Black and Tans. However, the county was an important axis for intelligence gathering and communications to the south and west, and it is here Kildare made its greatest impact. The open flat plains of Kildare militated against ambushes, while its proximity to the capital also inhibited the Kildare Volunteers. Nevertheless there was a strong revolutionary element in the county. The book looks at the group of Volunteers who followed the railway track into Dublin to partake in the 1916 Rising and details attacks at Greenhills, Maynooth and Barrowhouse. The author also examines the Rath internment camp in the Curragh, reaction in the county to the Truce and Treaty, and the eventual split in the republican movement in the lead up to civil war. This comprehensive account will be a valuable addition to literature on this formative period in Ireland\'s history.<br>James Durney is the author of \'The Civil War in Kildare\' (2011).

Although his works form the most impressive series of history paintings in Great Britain, they remain one of the British art world\'s best kept secrets.<br>Between 1777 and 1784, the Irish artist James Barry (1741-1806) executed six murals for the Great Room of the [Royal] Society of Arts in London.  Although his works form the most impressive series of history paintings in Great Britain, they remain one of the British art world\'s best kept secrets, having attracted little attention from critics or the general public. James Barry\'s Murals at the Royal Society of Arts is the first to offer an in-depth analysis of these remarkable paintings and the first to demonstrate that the artist was pioneering a new approach to public art in terms of the novelty of the patronage and the highly personal nature of his content.  Barry insisted on, and received, complete control over his subject matter, the first time in the history of Western art that the patron of a large, impressive interior agreed to such a demand.  The artist required autonomy in order to present his personal vision, which encompasses a rich and complex surface narrative as well as a hidden meaning that has gone unperceived for 230 years.  The artist disguised his deeper message due to its inflammatory nature.\nWere his meaning readily apparent, the Society would have thrown out him and his murals. Ultimately, as this book seeks to show, the artist intended his paintings to engage the public in a dialogue that would utterly transform British society in terms of its culture, politics, and religion.  In making this case, the book brings this neglected series into the mainstream of discussions of British art of the Romantic period, revealing the intellectual profundity invested in the genre of history painting and re-evaluating the role Christianity played in Enlightenmen',7367,'2016-02-07 00:00:00','2014-10-31','9781782051084.jpg','','','','','',1,0,0,0,416,'9781782051084',NULL,'',999999,NULL,'',''),('\'Dublin Strolls: Exploring Dublin\'s Architectural Treasures 2016\'','','','The Collins Press','http://www.collinspress.ie/','Lifestyle',38,'ARCHITECTURE / History / General; HISTORY / Europe / Ireland; History of architecture; British & Iri','\'Handy guide to Dublin\'s architecture is filled with easy-to-follow walks through the city, with clear maps, expert architectural insights and fascinating historical detail, not to mention beautiful hand-drawn illustrations.

Themes covered include hidden Dublin (including Isolde\'s Tower, the remains of a 13th-century defence tower discovered in the 1990s along with the skulls of a number of young men whose heads had been displayed on spikes); religious buildings (from Christ Church to the burial place of St Valentine); how buildings change their use over time (for example, City Hall, Bank of Ireland and Leinster House); and the buildings involved in the 1916 Rising (including the Royal College of Surgeons, City Hall, Liberty Hall, Kilmainham Gaol and, of course, the GPO).Dublin\'s long history has had a visible impact on its architecture: waves of invaders and the attempts by Dubliners to shake them off have left their mark, with the 1916 Easter Rising, for example, having led to the end of British rule but also left whole parts of the city in ruins.
